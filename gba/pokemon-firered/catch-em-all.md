## About

This is a checklist for the [Gotta Catch 'Em All! - FireRed achievement](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/33625). It allows the reader to mark off which Pok√©mon have been recorded in the Pok√©dex while providing pointers on how to potentially best acquire said Pok√©mon. 

## Introduction

The [Gotta Catch 'Em All! - FireRed achievement](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/33625) requires the player to obtain every single Pok√©mon that is accessible to the game <u>**without trading across cartridges**</u>. This means that Pok√©mon can only be caught, evolved, or obtained via in-game events (NPC trades, Game Center, etc).

Attempting to bring in Pok√©mon from other Gen 3 Pok√©mon games via trades will result in <u>**invalidating**</u> this achievement.

The achievement is missable for a variety of reasons so the goal of this guide is to avoid missing the achievement while providing a way to track progress.

In order to centralize information about Pok√©mon locations and the best way to obtain them, I made this guide. Pok√©mon FireRed Version has 170 Pok√©mon to register in the Pok√©dex to obtain this achievement. As you progress in the game (or perhaps as you search for that remaining Pok√©mon to finish the set!), use the checklist below to mark what you have found and get direction on how to obtain the Pok√©mon you need!

The primary source of data is [Serebii.net](https://serebii.net/fireredleafgreen/kantopokedex.shtml). I also used [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page) as a backup reference as well as the game itself as I worked on this achievement.

I recommend use of the [Quality of Life Enhancement Patch](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAPatches/blob/main/GBA/Improvement/515-PokemonFireRed-Enhanced.zip) that is authorized for use with this achievement set. This will be very useful for the evolution of some Pok√©mon that need specific stats since this patch reveals letter grades for stat growth potential of each Pok√©mon on the Summary screen.

## Checklist

The Notes section of the checklist identifies what may be the best way to efficiently find the particular Pok√©mon. However, your mileage may vary and I may not have noted something that may be easier. If you know of a better method, let me know and I will update the checklist!

To use the checklist, click on the link above. Open the File menu and choose "Make a copy". Name your copy of the checklist whatever you'd like and press the "Make a copy" button. Now you can mark off the Pok√©mon you have caught in the checklist and it will save automatically as you go. Happy hunting!

## Evolution Items

It is important to keep in mind that some evolution items are limited and require thoughtful use to prevent locking the achievement due to running out of items.

- Moon Stone
  - There are only five of them found in the game: Rocket Hideout, Pok√©mon Mansion, Joyful Game Corner (from Lostelle's father), and two in Mt. Moon
  - Only four Pok√©mon need one to evolve: Nidoking, Nidoqueen, Clefable, and Wigglytuff
  - There is **very** low chance (5%) of finding Clefairys holding a Moon Stone when caught. This is not ideal though as the grind to get an extra Moon Stone could be quite lengthy.
- Sun Stone
  - There is only one, which is located in Ruin Valley (found in a Pok√©ball requiring Strength to access)
  - Thankfully, there is only one Pok√©mon that can use it that is accessible without trading: Gloom!
- King's Rock
  - One is found in Sevault Canyon. More can be obtained via winning Mixed Battles in the Trainer Tower.
  - Only one is needed for FireRed Version to evolve a Politoed, since Slowpoke/Slowbro are not accessible.
- Soothe Bell
  - Helps expedite friendship evolutions, such as Crobat and Chansey
  - Find it on the top floor of the Pok√©mon Tower by using ItemFinder where Mr. Fuji stood
- Lax Incense
  - While functional in battle, it provides a unique function for breeding Wynaut by giving this item to Wobbuffet.
  - There is only one of this item, found at Lost Cave, so don't throw it away or you become locked out of the achievement.

## Fighting Dojo Pok√©mon Evolution

You can only obtain one of the three Tyrogue evolutions (specifically Hitmonlee or Hitmonchan) via completing the Fighting Dojo battles. The other two (one of the two from the dojo plus Hitmontop) must be carefully evolved from Tyrogue.

The problem with this is that evolution is based on the Attack and Defense stats when Tyrogue hits level 20:
- Hitmonlee: Attack stat is greater than Defense stat.
- Hitmonchan: Attack stat is less than Defense stat.
- Hitmontop: Attack and Defense stats are equal.

To get the two remaining Pok√©mon, you will need at least two Tyrogues. I say "at least two" because if a mistake happens with the stats, you'll need backups.

To get Tyrogue, you need to get an egg from the Four Island Day Care using your Ditto and FIghting Dojo Pok√©mon of choice. Eggs can take a while to appear, requiring walking in a location away from the Day Care. Once you have the egg, walk to hatch it. It takes a considerable amount of steps to hatch Tyrogues, even with a Slugma in your party. Pick a spot to pace that is comfortable for you. I used Fast Forward and paced up and down Route 5 to do this. After walking a while, I would go back to the Day Care to pick up another egg and continuing to walk both eggs at the same time. By the time the first egg hatches, another egg should be ready at the Day Care. Repeat until you have the number of Tyrogues you want.

When a Tyrogue hatches, check the Summary page to see the stats. If Attack and Defense are different, this Tyrogue would be ideally suited to become a Hitmonlee or Hitmonchan. If you have the Quality of Life Enhancement patch, you can even have a better idea of how different the stats will be as the Tyrogue levels up toward level 20. This isn't hard and fast though, as you can also use Protein and Iron items (purchased at Celadon Store and found throughout the game) to punch up specific stats as desired.

The problem lies with Hitmontop. Evolution will be based on the state of the stats at the time of leveling up to Level 20. The easiest way to do this is to save the game just prior to your Tyrogue reaching level 20. Then:
- Note the stats (and growth potential with the QoL patch).
- Adjust the stats using Protein and Iron so that Attack and Defense become even once it levels up.
- Get into battle and level up. If the Attack and Defense stats don't match, note how much the stats increased on the level up. Reload the save and use Protein or Iron to increase the opposite stat enough so that the level up will cause the stats to match.
  - For example: Tyrogue is level 19 with Attack and Defense both at 19. It seems like this will become a Hitmontop at the next level. After the next battle, Tyrogue gains +1 in Attack and +0 in Defense for a result of 20/19, so the stats are not matched. Reset the game and give the Tyrogue Iron to increase the Defense stat by 1. Next battle should have the same result on level up, and so now Attack and Defense are both 20/20 and evolution to Hitmontop will occur.
  - Note: There is a lot more nuance to stat growth, such as the IVs of the Tyrogue (which can be seen in the QoL patch) and EVs earned from fighting different Pok√©mon. EVs in particular can affect the stat growth from level 19 to 20. Fighting the same Pok√©mon for the level up should keep things consistent. All of this being said, your mileage may vary from the example above. Make use of the tools at your disposal to eventually get the Hitmontop. That is what the extra Tyrogues are for. üòÖ

## The Legendary Beasts

One of the three Legendary Beasts will begin to appear as a random encounter anywhere in the Kanto region (meaning they don't appear in Sevii Islands) grass tiles. The beast that appears is based on the starter chosen with a type advantage. For example: choosing Squirtle as a starter means that Raikou will appear as your legendary beast.

Since Kanto is very large, running into your legendary beast is very slim as they move around the map with every single map change! Additionally, the beasts like to run away! Fortunately, damage to the legendary Pok√©mon is retained across battles so you can reduce their health over time until they are catchable... or you can just throw a Master Ball at them.

Using a Master Ball is definitely ideal for this encounter as traditionally catching one of the legendary beasts is a huge time commitment and needs a lot of luck. We can also manipulate the game's mechanics to ensure that we encounter these beasts:
- Have a Pok√©mon between level 40-49 at the front of the party
- Have a bunch of Max Repels on hand (20 should be enough)
- Go to Route 2, to the grass area just south of the gate to Viridian Forest
- Save your game!
- Use your Repels and walk in the grass for about 10 seconds.
- If you don't have an encounter, go into the Viridian Forest gate and right back into the grass and repeat the walk for 10 seconds.
- Continue this loop until the legendary dog appears! Throw a Master Ball and win!
- If you didn't encounter one and ran out of your Repels, load your save and try again.
- **DANGER:** If Entei or Raikou use Roar, they are gone forever due to a bug. This is the other reason why it is ideal to use a Master Ball for this capture. If Roar is used, reload your save. This is also one of the biggest reasons why [Gotta Catch 'Em All - FireRed](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/33625) (and why [The Legendary Beasts](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/33624)) is missable.
