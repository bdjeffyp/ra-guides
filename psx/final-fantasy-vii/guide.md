**TODO:** Update the link and achievement count

This is not an official manual, walkthrough, or critical review. This document is a simple guide for the current achievement set (130 as of 9/23/2023) available on [RetroAchievements](https://retroachievements.org/game/3528). This guide will give the player tips on earning the achievements, hash compatibility, and any other necessary or useful information.

Spoiler solutions for the boss strategies and a potential order to earning the achievements will be hidden in a collapsible entry that you must click to expand so that only the solutions you need assistance with will be viewable. Some of the more minor achievements will have strategies written outright without a collapsible dropdown so use the guide at your own risk.

## Introduction

**TODO:** Update the intro, also probably a good point to discuss the history of this set and highlight the **David and Goliath** achievement. Specify that I am using the PlayStation face button identifiers when discussing controller inputs. Acknowledge the use of this guide (https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/faqs/71240/) as well as a general shoutout to all of the comments on various achievements. Also mention that there are a lot of comments on individual achievements regarding the status of Duckstation as an emulator that could potentially cause problems for people unlocking achievements but I have run the entire game with that emulator with no issue, except for some areas of the game where the emulator was more prone to hanging. This is the guide I used for **David and Goliath**: https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/faqs/32536. An issue with DuckStation is that disc changes tend to break things. Hardcore mode for achievements turns off and the emulator seems to lock up. Thankfully with saving before disc changes this isn't an issue. Other problems with DuckStation regarding fast forward may have been related to the disc speed setting, which I had a 2x. I lowered it down to normal speed when I reached Disc 3 so I'll see if any soft locks happen still.

Final Fantasy IV is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the Super Famicom. Released in Japan in 1991, it is the fourth installment in the Final Fantasy series. This game features a more story-driven approach (a la Final Fantasy II), centered around the dark knight Cecil. However, many of the mechanics introduced in Final Fantasy III make their return here: character job classes (though they are fixed for the most part), the Fat Chocobo, many vehicle options, graphic designs, and some dungeons that require specific mechanics to traverse. The similarities to Final Fantasy III are probably due to the game being initially designed for the Famicom/NES [(source)](https://web.archive.org/web/20161216181140/http://matotree.com/2012/08/final-fantasy-iv-for-the-famicom-was-80-complete/).

With the focus on plot, Final Fantasy IV will push you into situations that can lock you out of areas, characters, and abilities as you progress. As a result, many achievements for this game will become missable if you are not diligent. However, all achievements can be earned in one playthrough. This guide will attempt to help you in identifying the missable achievements if you'd rather not play this fantastic, but lengthy, game multiple times.

## Trivia

**TODO:** Update the trivia or remove the section. One piece of trivia I have so far is that the Huge Materia displayed in the planetarium are similar to the crystals of the original Final Fantasy with the same colors. It's probably a knowing nod to the original game but I haven't confirmed it. Picture: huge-materia-crystals.png.

- This achievement set, created by [MrGauss](https://retroachievements.org/User/MrGauss), uses lines from Dante's Divine Comedy for the story achievements. The demons known as "Malebranches" in the Divine Comedy are the inspiration for the Four Arch-Fiends.
- Final Fantasy IV has had numerous ports and remakes. Notoriously, the US version released on the Super NES was censored and made easier for the American market. In Japan, Square re-released Final Fantasy IV on the Super Famicom, called "Final Fantasy IV Easy Type". Many refer to "Easy Type" as the US version, but it is actually another iteration that builds off the US Version. You can read more about the many versions for the SNES/Super Famicom [here](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy_IV_version_differences), as well as all of the numerous other ports and their differences.
- A sequel game was developed for Japanese mobile phones, subtitled "The After Years". This game was eventually ported and released worldwide on the WiiWare service of the Nintendo Wii system and also experienced it's own share of ports and remakes.
- A 3D remake was released on the Nintendo DS, similar in appearance to the Final Fantasy III remake and made by the same studio, Matrix Software.

## Save Support

**TODO:** Update the save support section. Perhaps similar to what was used for DQ8. Mention my save strategy of using multiple saves across both save slots, filling up checkpoint saves from the bottom up. When both memory cards are full, I roll them back so that I have a new memory card with more slots. I'll probably have three or four memory cards by the end of this.

The game uses a battery to save game data across four slots. Players can save the game at any time while on the overworld map or in certain safe spots in dungeons to any one of the slots.

## Compatibility

**TODO:** Update this to be more in line with my other guides in how I discuss using the Supported Game Files page with a link to it

Currently (as of 9/23/2023) this game has 5 unique ROM(s) registered for it. View the linked hashes at the [Supported Game Files](https://retroachievements.org/linkedhashes.php?g=3528) page.

Please view the [Final Fantasy IV Official Thread](https://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=10172) for more details on setting up the ROM with the latest version of the Namingway Edition patch.

## Leaderboards

**TODO:** Update with the state of leaderboards for FFVII.

There are two leaderboards currently associated with the game.

- [Game Speed Run](https://retroachievements.org/leaderboardinfo.php?i=8113) - The fastest time needed to finish the game
- [Sum of party level](https://retroachievements.org/leaderboardinfo.php?i=8114) - The lowest level of all characters at game's end

## Achievement Categories

**TODO:** Update with my categorizations for this set that I will figure out after writing my notes. Also, this section should link to the breakdown sections below.

There are a currently a total of 130 achievements, which can be broken down into the following categories:

- **Story/Progression**: 14 achievements earned naturally through the course of gameplay
- **Summons**: 4 achievements related to summons for Rydia earned by going to out-of-the-way locations (**1 is missable**)
- **Boss Challenge**: 18 achievements (**17 are missable**) that require special action during boss fights by the player to successfully earn the achievement
- **Commands**: 24 achievements (**15 are missable**) that require use of the special commands of characters in certain situations or completion of a specific objective in one gameplay session
- **Treasure**: 33 achievements (**4 are missable**) which require finding all treasure, including hidden items, in a specified location
- **Dancer**: 8 achievements which require talking to specific NPCs
- **Chicobo Quest**: 15 achievements which require you to find a specific, out-of-the-way, location hinted in the achievement description and pressing the [Y] button.
- **Endgame Items**: 3 achievements (**1 is marked as missable for it's difficulty**) for items which are earned by events and grinding
- **Miscellaneous**: 11 achievements (**1 is missable**) that don't fit in the above categories, including 2 related to a specific endgame item to help avoid missing it
- Out of all of the achievements, **39 are missable**

## Potential Order

**TODO:** There will definitely be a roadmap for this set. Two playthroughs minimum.

The following is a breakdown of the order of achievements based on my personal playthrough. Note that your mileage may vary due to the path you may desire to take, such as getting Odin before going to the Moon.

Each section is grouped under story achievements and hidden under a dropdown to avoid spoilers. If you want to see the achievements, **click on the arrow** next to each section to reveal the table. The dropdown names have the number of achievements in the section so that you can see at a glance about how many achievements you should have by the end of a section, if you were to follow my guide to the letter. I have call outs to sections where a grind may be appropriate for the three grind achievements. If you want to see the entire thing without having to click the arrows, [checkout the fully expanded roadmap!](Final-Fantasy-IV-Roadmap)

:no_entry: **MINOR SPOILER SECTION** :no_entry:
<br>The tables only reveal when achievements can be earned and possibly missed. No strategies on earning the achievements are provided here, just the order I earned them in.

**Grind alert!** Goblins in the overworld very rarely drop their eponymous summon. The only other Goblin type that drops the summon is in the Lunar Subterrane with the same drop rate.

**Grind alert!** Mindflayers in the Magnetic Cave can very rarely drop their eponymous summon. This is the only location they appear in this game, which is pretty inconvenient. It may be best to grind for the summon AFTER defeating the Dark Elf since the cave's magnetic properties will subside.

**Grind alert!** Balloons in the Tower of Babil can very rarely drop their eponymous summon. You can also get it from them and the Grenades on the Moon later, if you'd rather wait, since the drop rate is low.

**NOTE:** Elemental Cure is broken. It triggers when a FellKnight uses Absorb in the Defender Sword Monster-in-a-Box fight. It should be available to earn when a character has a Cursed Ring with an elemental reducing armor equipped. It isn't too big of a deal that this one achievement out of 130 pops early, given that you still need to grind for a Cursed Ring anyway... ðŸ˜‰

**Grind alert!** If you don't have the remaining summon items, now is the time to get them. You will also be grinding for Pink Tail(s) in the Lunar Subterrane, and the Cursed Ring from the Souls and Spirits at Mt. Ordeals if you didn't get that earlier.

The final boss must be fought more than once to complete the set. I would think it may be best to beat the game with the full party first, reload the save, then grind to get Cecil ready for the final fight...

Special call out: The incredibly grind heavy Evil Jewelry, Summoning Mastery, and One of a Kind. They are not included in the order list above because of the rare drops involved in their achievements: 1/64 chance for the applicable item IF an item drops from the monster. See the Grind section below for strategies on how to complete the grind.

## Category Breakdowns

**TODO:** Obviously, this will get an overhaul on my strategies when I take my notes and put them here...

### Story/Progression

No discussion on the progression achievements here as you simply need to play through the game to earn them. You can't miss them!

### Summons

The three non-missable summons achievements are standard boss fights with no special requirements for boss challenge achievements. Therefore, have fun with these fights and experiment on your own or refer to your favorite strategy guide/GameFAQ for details.

The only missable achievement in this section is [Loyal Friend](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108637). **It is only available between when Kain leaves the group before going to the Moon!** When the opportunity presents itself to go to the Moon, it would be wise to fully explore the world to wrap up any loose ends before departing.

<details>
<summary>Expand for spoiler</summary>

- Find Yang in the Sylphs' Cave
- Go to Fabul to see Sheila and get the Frying Pan
- Go back to Sylphs' Cave and use the Frying Pan on Yang.

This series of steps is also closely related to the [Bull's Eye](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108675) achievement and why that is also marked as missable.

</details>

### Boss Challenge

:no_entry: **HERE, THERE BE SPOILERS!** :no_entry:

This is where the meat of the achievement set is at! If you wish to challenge yourself, I recommend not expanding the strategies I used to complete these fun and puzzling achievements. Make use of nearby save spots where possible and experiment with the skills and items you have to complete these very awesome challenges!

| Badge | Title | Strategy |

| [![Mist dragon](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/109793.png "The Steel and the Mist")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108640) | [The Steel and the Mist](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108640) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Don't attack while she is in Mist form, only while in Dragon form. Take a couple of rounds of attacks for both Kain and Cecil and then wait for it to change forms. Repeat until dead. Use mist form rounds for healing if necessary. </details> |
| [![Soldier with a sword](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/109814.png "No Messengers Left")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108641) | [No Messengers Left](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108641) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Take out two guards, then concentrate on the General.

I recommend lowering the battle speed to 6 in order to give your characters more chances to attack. If you are still having trouble defeating Octomamm with a large enough hit to kill him before he goes to one leg remaining, you may need to grind a bit for levels to raise your base strength. </details> |
| [![An insectoid monster with bug eyes and gaping toothy mouth](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/110965.png "Reactionless Jaws")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108643) | [Reactionless Jaws](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108643)      | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>_Unfortunately, I didn't keep notes on this fight and don't have a save nearby to verify my memory here..._ Don't physically attack! Using Cecil's Dark is key, since that is not a physical attack and doesn't consume MP. Keep Cecil's health up with potions from Edward and Rydia. Another possibility is to have Edward Sing and hope that it causes the Charm status effect so that the Antlion attacks itself. </details> |
| [![Large red bomb-type monster](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/111289.png "Explosive Sync")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108644) | [Explosive Sync](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108644) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>When Mom Bomb grows full size, cease attacks. A party member will say, "It's gonna blow!". As it explodes and begins to split into the six bombs, use a Silk Web item to slow the bombs immediately. Have Yang use Kick to knock down the health of all the bombs slightly. Now cycle to Edward and have him attack each blue bomb individually to get their health in range, hopefully without critical hits. Once all three blue bombs were attacked without dying, a single Dark command from Cecil should take them all out in one shot and the achievement will be awarded. </details> |
| [![Horned zombie demon](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/113138.png "Malebranche of Earth")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108645) | [Malebranche of Earth](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108645) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Use Palom's Boost command until maxed out (6 times?). Then have Palom cast Fira on Scarmiglione. This will meet the requirement of taking out the boss with only one action **on him!** My Palom was Level 19 when I got this achievement. </details> |
| [![Serpent faced humanoid with snakes for hands](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/113431.png "Minimalist Struggle")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108646) | [Minimalist Struggle](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108646) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Note that party members can die but must be alive before the battle ends! Make sure to save in the Ancient Waterway. Have Tellah cast Mini on your party prior to entering the central hall of Baron Castle. Since you are Mini, Palom cannot use his Boast command to strengthen his spells. Palom should use his strongest spells: Quake, or Bio if Quake isn't available yet. I recommend getting Quake unlocked in the Ancient Waterway if you don't have it though. Buff your party with Tellah and Porom casting Blink to avoid taking too much damage. Since Baigan's body counters spells with Reflect, use low level spells on his body to wear off the effect. I used Cure twice on him to bounce a healing spell back at my party while wearing off his Reflect. It can take two hits before the Reflect wears off. Once it does, use Quake again to win. </details> |
| [![Turtle demon surrounded by raging waters](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/113433.png "Malebranche of Water")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108647) | [Malebranche of Water](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108647) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>No one can die this time around. Since you just fought Baigan, it would be wise to return to the Ancient Waterway to save your game again. You can use a Tent here or use Cecil's bed to heal up as well. If you have your battle speed at or near "1", you may want to lower it. I found that Cagnazzo is too quick and fires off Haste before Tellah is even able to cast a spell when the battle speed was at "1". Once I lowered the speed down to "6", this challenge was in the bag. Have Palom cast Bio and Tellah cast Thundaga, skipping everyone else. Those two spells should put Cagnazzo inside his shell before he casts Haste if it doesn't kill him outright. Cast one more Bio or Thundara/Thundaga to finish up the fight. </details> |
| [![Squat, yet long limbed, creature with long hair and a horn](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/117082.png "Winds of Victory")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108648) | [Winds of Victory](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108648) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Only the Dark Dragon phase of this fight matters for the achievement. Dark Dragon is susceptible to Tornado (hence the name of the achievement). Care must be taken to not have actions queued when the Dark Elf changes into the Dark Dragon as any extra actions taken will invalidate the achievement. In my many attempts, I found that my party took 10 attack actions on the Dark Elf before it changed. Your party levels may be different though so use caution around 7-8 attacks on the Elf. Once it does change, use Tornado and then follow with an attack from any other character. Do note though that Tornado still has a chance to fail. If it does fail, it still counts as an action on the boss and thus a reset is required. It can be annoying to reset and then deal with the story stuff and equipment changes but fast-forward is your friend... </details> |
| [![Three women: one tall with a spear and one short with a knife](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/117122.png "Magical Miscalculation")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108649) | [Magical Miscalculation](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108649) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Some have talked about Tellah having Dispel and using that to cancel out the Reflect status on Cindy; however, my Tellah did not have Dispel. I also saw people talk about casting Silence on Sandy so that she can't cast Reflect. I was never able to get Silence to stick though. So, I attacked Cindy until her health was low, doing approximately 4000 HP of damage. Note that Cid's Study and Libra spells don't work, so you'll have to keep track of the damage dealt in your head. When you think you are close, kill Sandy. While Cid, Yang, and Cecil attack Sandy, have Tellah cast Cura on Cindy to try to wear down her Reflect status. I found that when Sandy puts Reflect on Cindy, the status will stay on just until I have killed Sandy, which will then expose Cindy to Mindy's spells. If you time it right and have Cindy's health low enough, Mindy will end up killing Cindy and the achievement will pop. There may be better ways to do this, but this is the process that worked for me. Make sure you save right after this fight since another boss challenge follows shortly after this! </details> |
| [![Woman with long hair wrapped around her like a whirlwind](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/117137.png "Malebranche of Wind")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108650) | [Malebranche of Wind](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108650) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Yang's Focus will be the primary damage dealer since you can't use Kain's Jump to break up Barbariccia's whirlwind form. Focus will ignore the defense of the whirlwind. So, focus your efforts on keeping everyone alive and not fully petrifying. Cecil and Rosa can provide healing and Esuna. Cid and Kain can use Gold Needles and healing potions. There is some luck involved in this with Barbariccia's Tornados landing their hit or not. If the Tornado does connect, heal that character immediately (Yang should still Focus though). If Barbariccia does her follow up physical attack on the tornado'd character, they'll die. You may benefit from lowering your battle speed on this fight. Barbariccia's Ray does gradual petrification. So you have a few rounds before you need to cure the effect. You'll know it is close when the character looks like they are fully stone but still standing and able to act. If Gold Needles are running low, take a chance and only recover the debuff when they look like they are fully grey. Do note that Ray cast on the same character multiple times speeds this up. If a character gets hit by Ray twice in a row, focus on curing the affected person. </details> |
| [![Large and creepy doll with crown and hair in pigtails](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/117225.png "Danse Macabre")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108651) | [Danse Macabre](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108651) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>For every Calca doll taken down, a Brina doll must also fall. Attack on Brina doll, then kill one Calca. Continue attacking the dolls in pairs like that. When there is only one pair remaining, the Brina doll is weaker so that should be the last doll standing. Concentrate attacks on the last Calca doll and all attacks will then shift to the final Brina, which should fall quickly before it can change to Calcabrina. </details> |
| [![A small person pilots a giant humanoid robot](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/117412.png "Clockwork Destruction")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108652) | [Clockwork Destruction](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108652) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>The first phase of the fight, when Dr. Lugae and Barnab are separate, use Haste spells and Hermes items to speed up the entire party. Attack Barnab until it falls. Bring up Yang's menu. As soon as Dr. Lugae talks about taking manual control, select the Focus command. Have the next character use a Silk Web item or cast Slow on Barnab-Z. Now have everyone attack. I managed to get lucky on my attempt and Rosa did a critical hit with Aim, followed by Yang's standard attack killing Barnab-Z. I think even without the crit, I was on track to beating out Barnab-Z's explosion with everyone attacking, Rosa Aiming, and Rydia casting Thundara. </details> |
| [![Red faced demon draped in red and blue cape with hand extended](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/117556.png "Malebranche of Fire")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108653) | [Malebranche of Fire](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108653) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Perhaps the toughest challenge?? Rosa needs to know Reflect, which she learns at level 36. This fight is a matter of timing. Since you cannot target Rubicante directly, you will need to set Reflect on a party member and then have Rydia bounce Blizzara off that character. This will take about 11 hits to accomplish (my Rydia at level 36 required that many hits). Rubicante's pattern: opens his cloak and uses his Scorch technique, closes his cloak, physically attacks one or two characters, and repeats. Rosa should cast Reflect on a surviving party member after Rubicante's physical attacks, which should be cast before he opens his cloak. Ensure Rydia is ready to cast as soon as Rubicante opens his cloak, then select the Blizzara spell and target your party member that has the Reflect status. This should hit Rubicante before he uses Scorch. If Rubicante Scorches, he will close his cloak immediately after, so it is very important to cast Blizzara as he opens his cloak or you will miss. Contingencies will be needed as party members are attacked and die. Edge, Cecil, and Kain should be using Phoenix Downs to revive characters. If Rosa or Rydia are taken out, you may miss a cycle. Take time to breathe and think through every action. I found this challenge to be very intense because of the concentration needed and finding the rhythm. It was very satisfying to accomplish! In my first attempt at this, I didn't have nearly enough Phoenix Downs and needed to leave the Tower of Babil to stock back up. In my second attempt, I was trying to keep people healed with Cecil's Cura or Hi-Potions, but found that would cause problems with the cycle so I only focused on raising dead party members. Keeping people alive increases targets for Rubicante's attacks and thus less chance of targeting Rydia or Rosa. Of course, balance is key. If you can't get back into a cycle because he keeps taking out your party, take some rounds to restore with stronger spells or items and then get back into the rhythm again. Good luck!! </details> |
| [![The facade of a toothy grinning demon emerging from a wall](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/117870.png "Under Pressure")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108654) | [Under Pressure](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108654) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>After the final save point in the Sealed Cave, there is one more TrapDoor to face before entering the Crystal Chamber. You may want to defeat the door before setting yourself up for this fight and possibly go back up to the save point, just in case. Set battle mode to Active and lower battle speed AND battle message to 6. Active is required for the achievement and a speed of 6 will give you more time to react. If you cleared out the Sylph Cave prior to going to the Sealed Cave, the Avenger Sword can be beneficial. Use a Silk Web or cast Slow to slow down the Demon Wall, use Bacchus Wines or cast Berserk on your front line, and have Rydia summon Leviathan. The Silk Web will cause Demon Wall to retaliate with a gradual petrification spell, but you can ignore it since you will beat the boss before that takes full effect. Characters won't be able to do anything until the wall has already moved two times and probably won't make their first actions after the third movement. I tried this a few times, changing the battle speed to see when I can get my party to act sooner, but a speed of 6 for both battle speed and message was key. Additionally, I got good damage rolls from Rydia's Leviathan and a crit from Edge, so luck may play a part in this. I also moved items and spells around in order to put them where the cursor appears in the menu to speed up my actions. Another possibility could be to Haste party members, especially the one with the Avenger Sword or Rydia (but I haven't tried this...). </details> |
| [![The faces of the four malebranches](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/118439.png "Fiendish Rematch")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108655) | [Fiendish Rematch](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108655) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>If you did some grinding for Alerts/Sirens and repeatedly fought monsters summoned by the Searchers, you will have no issues with the Arch Fiends this time around. Fusoya's Bless keeps health bumped up with Rosa supplementing healing. Rosa should focus on anyone who get's dangerously close to low health (especially Edge). Use Rydia's opposing third level elemental spell or Bahamut if you have him at this point, Haste Cecil and have him attack, use Edge's opposing elemental Ninjutsu as appropriate also. </details> |
| [![Three floating metallic spheres](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/118446.png "Fatal Error")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108656) | [Fatal Error](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108656) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>The order to take down the nodes is Defense, CPU, Attack. If the Defense and Attack nodes are killed before the CPU, you will lose this challenge. So, the biggest concern is accidentally killing the Attack node before the CPU is defeated. Since the CPU casts Reflect on itself, you have no choice but to physically attack it. Have Fusoya keep your health up with Bless to negate the Attack node's paltry attack beams and keep on attacking the CPU. Once that is down, kill the Attack node and the achievement will pop! </details> |
| [![A shadowy ghost howling](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/118874.png "Cosmic Duel")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108657) | [Cosmic Duel](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108657) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>This should be easy enough if you have been grinding for the Adamant Armor. Have a healthy stack of Elixirs available as well, which you should have enough money to buy a bunch from the Flan Princess fights. When the battle with Zeromus begins and everyone is revived by your friends, kill them off again before using the Crystal. With the final battle now beginning, switch between attacks and using Elixirs. You may have some opportunities to get two attacks in, depending on if Zeromus used Flare, Meteor, or Holy on you successfully. You should have too much difficulty with this at this point though, if you have been working on getting everything you need for all of the achievements in one playthrough. Do note though that you will have to fight Zeromus twice in order to get this achievement as well as Shadow Hands. I opted for Shadow Hands first and then followed up with Cosmic Duel.<br/><br/>A brilliant suggestion by [Kencussion](https://retroachievements.org/user/Kencussion) regarding getting both Shadow Hands AND Cosmic Duel in one battle:<br/>"Keep your whole party alive when you start battle with Zeromus, but do NOT use the Crystal right away. The achievement for beating Zeromus with only Cecil begins once the Crystal is used... so before you use the Crystal, have Edge steal the Dark Matter from Zeromus' first form to get the 'Shadow Hands' achievement. Then kill off everyone in your party except Cecil (you may want Rosa to buff Cecil first), and then have him use the Crystal on Zeromus. When Zeromus reveals his second form, only Cecil will be alive and you can get the 'Cosmic Duel' achievement!"</details> |

### Commands

The intent of these achievements is to showcase the utility of the character's various special abilities, as they were not present in the original US release. They provide a great preview of how they work and their necessity in completing some of the boss challenge achievements. It is recommended trying to get these achievements as soon as the necessary character joins your party, because a lot of them are missable.

| Badge | Title | Tips |
|:---:|---|---|
| [![Dark knight with sword raised to strike](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/109686.png "Ultimate Darkness")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108658) | [Ultimate Darkness](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108658) | The best place for this is in the area around the Antlion's Den and Mt. Hobs. There is an encounter with eight Goblins, which is perfect fodder for taking down with one Dark command. |
| [![Dragoon knight jumping onto an enemy](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/109786.png "Deadly Acrobatics")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108659) | [Deadly Acrobatics](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108659) | You will find flying enemies right out the gate in the fields surrounding Baron. A perfect time to get this when also doing an early attempt at getting the Goblin summon. |
| [![Old man Tellah thinking with speech bubble](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/109916.png "No Enough Omega-3")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108660) | [Not Enough Omega-3](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108660) | Just start using the Recall command as much as you can when you first get Tellah. Watch your MP though and rest to recover it as needed. |
| [![Singing bard](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/109921.png "Siren's Pupil")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108661) | [Siren's Pupil](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108661) | Simply use Edward's Sing command as much as you can as soon as he joins and you'll unlock this in no time. |
| [![Purple frog wearing bard's red hat](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/110002.png "Song of the Frogs")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108662) | [Song of the Frogs](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108662) | Once Rydia learns Toad, cast the spell on Edward and Sing to attempt to turn a monster into a Toad. Note that the song must successfully transform the monster. I found it best to attempt this on Goblins around Mt. Hobs/Antlion's Den. |
| [![Bard character surrounded by magic effects](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/110000.png "Salve of Salvation")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108663) |  [Salve of Salvation](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108663) | There is some controversy surrounding this achievement. It seems to require the Namingway Edition patch of the game to work properly, despite the set being linked to a base FF4(J) ROM. This is because the intent of the achievement is to use Salve when you have a party of five to heal for a total of 375 HP or greater. Since the Namingway Edition patch buffs the Salve command, it seems to only be possible with that patch to unlock this achievement. That is why the patch is the only recommended way to play through this achievement set. |
| [![Bard cowering in fear](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/110001.png "Spoony Bard")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108664) | [Spoony Bard](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108664) | Just manually hide Edward with the Hide command and then win a battle. I'm not sure if it pops the achievement with Edward hiding automatically when his health is low though. I didn't wait to see if that was the case... |
| [![White wizard with one eye closed and drawing back a bow with an arrow](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/111279.png "Supreme Aim")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108665) | [Supreme Aim](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108665) | Rosa doesn't have the Mini spell right away. I tried to get this achievement with the Tiny Mages but they are not in Mini status so they don't count. You will need to first use Mini on monsters successfully, then use Aim to kill them. Again, Goblins are a perfect candidate for this. There is no pressure for this achievement because it is not missable. |
| [![White wizard praying](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/111281.png "Hoping for a Miracle")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108666) | [Hoping for a Miracle](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108666) | Another command achievement that is not missable, but it is best to try to get this in a controlled situation. Since Pray is not 100% successful, it could be better to wait to get this when party members enter critical state with a lot of HP left over. You could also just try to Pray often as soon as you get Rosa when two characters are near death. It's up to you. |

### Treasure

There are **four** locations that are missable: Tower of Zot, Tower of Babil first visit, Tower of Babil second visit, and Giant of Babil.

I am not going into details on treasure locations since there are a ton of pre-existing resources out there that map the locations of every treasure and hidden item in the game. I made use of mostly excellent maps at [GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/snes/588330-final-fantasy-iv/faqs) to get all of these achievements.

Some minor notes:
<br>From the beginning of the game, you can start on the Chocobo Forest Treasure Hunter achievement. Don't forget to grab the Gysahl Green in the grass of every Chocobo Forest.
<br>The Chocobo Village has two Gysahl Greens hidden in grass on the far right. There is a path through the trees by the "back of the head" of the Chocobo.
<br>A chest with 1000 gil in Kokkol's Forge is hidden to the right of the stairs going to the second floor.

### Dancer

Talk to every NPC in towns to ensure you get these. Since none are missable, I won't go into detail here on where to find them. The dancer in Fabul Castle is VERY close to the King's bedroom though, so that is the perfect opportunity to get the [Regal Rest](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108729) achievement as well!

### Chicobo Quest

The achievement set creator, [MrGauss](https://retroachievements.org/User/MrGauss), made great descriptions that help to hint at the correct location. However, they also provided close up images of the badges for the Chicobo Quest achievements if the image in the locked achievement is too blurry. These can help in finding the correct location to stand and press the "Y" button on your controller.

### Endgame Items, a.k.a. The Grind

**Setup:** When I do grinding for achievements, I make good use of the tools at my disposal to make the grind a bit easier and more comfortable. Since this is a Super NES game, I make use of the triggers (or L2/R2) to do fast-forward toggling. If I want to speed up the action, I hold down the trigger to activate fast-forward. For extended grinding sessions, rather than hold the trigger, I keep fast-forward active (using the '-' key on the keyboard) and then my trigger is used to temporarily turn off fast-forward until I let go.
<br>In the late game, grinds can be done easily by quickly moving left and right (or up and down) in the area where the desired encounters are and hold down the "B" button to run. When the battle starts, I let go of "B" and hold down the "A" button so that everyone attacks. When the battle ends, I make sure to continue to hold down "A" through the item menu if it appears. If you switch back to the "B" button, you could lose the item!
<br>In all item grinds, quantity of the desired enemy matters. Every enemy instance has a chance to drop an item and then if they drop they have a 1/64 chance of dropping the required item for the grind. For example, three Spirits and a Soul in one battle will provide a greater chance at dropping a Cursed Ring rather than one Dinozombie.

[![Ring topped with jeweled skull emitting evil aura](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/118270.png "Evil Jewelry")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108718) [Evil Jewelry](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108718): A great time to initially grind for this item would be right after Cecil becomes a paladin. To support this, purchase the armor for a paladin (Light Shield, Light Helm, Knight Armor, and Gauntlet) from Mysidia before going to Mt. Ordeals. Since Cecil is level 1 when he becomes a paladin, you can now grind for levels for him as well as attempting to get the Cursed Ring from the Souls and Spirits on Mt. Ordeals. Once Cecil class changes, go down to the base of the mountain and look for Souls and Spirits to grind on. There is a group of three Spirits and one Soul that is perfect. Make use of **Twincast** with the Twins to speed up the battles! If you need to heal, you can run out of Mt. Ordeals to the Chocobo Forest to the south and restore your MP at the White Chocobo. If you don't find a Cursed Ring by the time Cecil reaches level 20, then it may be better to wait until later to get it. I personally didn't get the Cursed Ring until the end game, having to grind at Mt. Ordeals while watching Twitch so that I wouldn't get board and leaving the game on fast-forward the entire time. Do note that the achievement pops as soon as you win the battle, since the item drops are determined at that time.

[![An open book with a bubble containing fire floating over it](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/118132.png "Summoning Mastery")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108681) [Summoning Mastery](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108681): There are four monster summons you can get as very rare item drops: Goblin, Bomb, Mindflayer, and Cockatrice. See the below chart for enemies and locations to grind for the drop:

| Spell | Monster | Location |
|:---:|---|---|
| Goblin | Goblin, Li'l Killer/Murderer | Outside Baron, around Mt.Hobs/Antlion Den |
| Bomb | Grenade, Balloon | Lunar Surface |
| Mindflayer | Mindflayer | Magnetic Cavern |
| Cockatrice | Cockatrice | Around and outside of Mt. Hobs |

[![A glittering armored breastplate](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/118808.png "One of a Kind")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108720) [One of a Kind](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108720): This is the grind that most people think of when it comes to Final Fantasy IV. Getting the Pink Tail actually isn't as bad as it could be, if you are prepared. This achievement set actually provides a couple of achievements to aid you in this grind: [Alert!](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108732) and [Avatar of Patience](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108733).
<br>The Alert! achievement is designed to let you know the ideal area to grind for the Siren item: the Giant of Babil's head. While this is a great location to grind for experience, you don't actually need to grind for the Siren items from the Searcher enemy. That's because Sirens are for sale in the Hummingway Haven on the Moon if you are playing the Namingway Edition patch, like you should be. If you do want to get Sirens from the Searchers, kill off your party except for Edge and steal the item from the Searchers over and over again.
<br> The Avatar of Patience achievement tells you the room to use the Sirens in when you explore the Lunar Subterrane. Using a Siren in this room will make a group of five dancing Pink Flans appear. This fight can be difficult if your party is weak and Cecil doesn't have his Crystal gear or the Ribbons for Rydia and Rosa. Pink Flans can be killed easily with a couple Bahamut summons or just attacks if your party is at a high enough level. Just take care to heal. A lot of progress can be lost with a party wipe.
<br>Once you **finally** have a Pink Tail, return to Earth and give the item to the tail collector in the Adamant Grotto.

## Notes

The guide I am using primarily for navigating the game is https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/faqs/71240.

### Disc 1

**On Guard**: (Boss) The first achievement and also first missable. The game instructs you on how to deal with Guard Scorpion's counterattack too. Just don't attack while the tail is up. The boss will take four rounds (two Search Scopes and two attacks) before raising it's tail so do as much damage as you can before that happens. When you get near the point where it could attack, stop issuing commands (unless using items) and wait out the tail. Once the camera begins to shift back to the side view, you can start issuing attack commands again. If you are using Cloud's Bolt and limit breaks as they happen, you should be able to beat the boss before it can raise it's tail again. Also, putting Barret in the back row is always a good idea since he is a ranged attacker, so you might as well do that here, especially if you are prepping for **The Great Escape**.

**The Great Escape**: (Challenge? Minigame?) Getting out of the reactor before 7:45 on the timer is not too hard if you prepare a little before the Guard Scorpion fight. In the Config menu, place ATB on Active, and Battle Speed and Battle Message to the far left for the fastest speed. ATB may not matter too much since we are just going to be running from battles, but I had it on Active anyway just in case. Active wasn't impactful to the Guard Scorpion fight either. Next, go to the screen where you fight Guard Scorpion, pick up the Restore materia, then go back a screen and save your game. Reset the console and reload. On the save crystal screen, walk around near the screen transition until you have two encounters. The first encounter will take a little bit to appear (it should be two Grunts and a Sweeper, in my experience). The second encounter will occur relatively quickly afterword (it should be a Sweeper, in my experience). Now, go fight Guard Scorpion. After the battle, begin to run back through the reactor the way you came in. Save Jessie on the way to the elevator. If you were efficient in your movements, you should have your first of two encounters as you approach Jessie. When the battle transitions occur, hold onto the L1+R1 (top bumper buttons) to escape the battle. In my experience, this was a fight with two Grunts and two Mono Drives so it can seem like you might be in the fight for a little while but you'll still have plenty of time. My time at escaping this battle was 9:20. In the room before the elevator, it's pretty easy to get caught on the railing for the stairs, but it shouldn't affect you getting out in time. In the elevator, press the button, close the dialog, and hold Left on the D-pad. Once the elevator stops, you'll run right out of the door easily. Talk to Jessie, then to Biggs. As you run toward the exit, your second encounter will happen (three Grunts). Then you are out of the door and the achievement will pop! My time was 8:02 with this strategy.

**A Thorough First Mission:** (Treasure) There are five items to get for this achievement. Four are located in Reactor 1 and one is in the surrounding street area after the bombing mission. The first two are potions on the two red uniformed guards knocked out by Biggs and Jessie at the very beginning of the game. The third is a Phoenix Down in a treasure chest in a room south of the elevator after Biggs and Jessie open the two doors. The last item in the reactor is the Potion on the floor where Jessie stands watch/gets stuck while you fight Guard Scorpion. The last item is on the ground near the fountain on the screen south of Aerith selling flowers.

**Seeing the Sights:** (Event) Missable because after you leave Sector 7, this NPC will have moved and events will prevent this conversation from happening. To get the event, after arriving at the Sector 7 Slums train station, there is a Save Crystal in the next screen. Just above that is an NPC who appears to be urinating near the fence leading to the plate support pillar. Talk to/interrupt them and they will foreshadow the future while you look at the pillar and get the achievement.

**The Wonders of the Base:** (Treasure) You'll need to get the first two items for this achievement before leaving Sector 7 Slums for the bombing of Reactor 5. Both are located in the Beginner's Hall above the weapon shop. Pick up the All materia on the ground near the entrance and then open the treasure chest that appears afterword to get an Ether.

**Keeping Track:** (Treasure) There are three items in total. When the lockdown event starts, go the rear of the initial car and talk to the person laying down on the seats to get a Phoenix Down. Return to the front of the screen to get to the next car. Head toward the screen and speak to the person near the exit and respond with "Yeah..." (the first option) to get a Hi-Potion. Move onto the third car and run into a pickpocket. Run after the pickpocket and talk to them. Respond with "That's right" (the second option) to get your money back. Head to the fourth car. There are no items here. Proceed as normal to jump off the train. The achievement should then pop after the conversation with Tifa and Barret in the tunnel.

**Above and Below the Plate:** (Treasure) There are eight items to get across the Sector 4 Plate area, Reactor 5, and Sector 5 Slums. Before entering Reactor 5, ensure you have three items measured. The first item is found in the duct after leaving the train, an Ether. The next item, a Potion, is in the room with Jessie, partially hidden by a wall. Finally, the third item is a tent located conveniently by the save crystal before entering the reactor area. In the reactor area, there is only one item, which is an Ether in a treasure chest found after leaving the elevator to the control room. You should have four items measured at this point before fighting Air Buster.

**Busted Up:** (Challenge) The best way to prepare for this is to get into an encounter in the location just before the boss, where you found the Ether in the chest and pressed the buttons at the same time to open the door to the save crystal. During the preparation battle, simply let your party get attacked until all three have hit their limit breaks. Use the Cure spell or items to heal if needed. In my experience, I had an encounter with two Special Combatants and a Proto Machinegun to get my limit breaks. Save the game and then proceed to the boss. Without any grinding, my party was all level 8, except Tifa at level 6. All three characters used their limit breaks right away and we took down Air Buster before it could take a turn. Air Buster may counter attack (it did, in my experience, against Barret's Big Shot), but that doesn't count against you as the boss having taken a turn.

**A Flower Blooming in the Slums:** (Challenge? Minigame? Puzzle?) Unfortunately, the only save point before this is prior to Air Buster, so if a mistake is made, you'll have a bit of a run back to make. The easiest way to handle this is to simply tell Aerith to "Hold on a minute" (first option) and push barrels in the following order: left, rear, and right. When Aerith makes it to the top of the stairs, the achievement will unlock.

**Above and Below the Plate (cont'd):** (Treasure) Once you enter the Sector 5 Slums, you can continue to work on this achievement. This is the point to note that there is one required item to get that impacts **Good Things Happen For Those Who Wait** by taking the kid's life savings (which will unlock **Killing Hope** as well). You can either set up a save at Aerith's house prior to getting the kid's life savings, get the remaining treasure and this achievement, then go back to the save and leave the life savings alone (you'll have to actually talk to the kid, check the hidden drawer, see the money, and then choose NOT to take it) so that you can get the other achievement later. Now for the remaining four items... Items five and six are located outside of Aerith's house (Cover materia and Ether). Item seven is in the bag in room you rest in inside Aerith's house. Item eight is the kid's money.

**Killing Hope/Good Things Happen For Those Who Wait:** (Mutually Exclusive) Missable achievements that are dependent on checking for the kid's life savings in the Sector 5 Slums and deciding to take or leave them. Take them to get **Killing Hope** or leave them and get the other achievement much later in the game. This is an easy one to get both in one run by using a save (as discussed in **Above and Below the Plate**) but one can also be deferred for the **David and Goliath** run. I went for both now, since **Killing Hope** is easy to get and reset to prep for the other.

**Moulin a Cafe:** Here is your first chance to read the first Turtle Paradise notice in the Turbo Ether kid's room (on the wall by the stairs).

**The Ballad of Heisenberg:** (Meme) You can purchase a grenade as early as Sector 5 Slums at the weapon shop near Aerith's House.

**A &$#% Up Moment/Group Bath and Taking Out the Small Fry/Dude (Looks Like a Lady):** (Mutually Exclusive) These sets of achievements are mutually exclusive that are dependent on performance in minigames and a choice of which room you enter in the Honeybee Inn. My intended path here is to go for the worst items (Lingerie/Phoenix Down) and associated achievements first, then reload the save and get the best items/achievements (Bikini Briefs/Hyper). I'll get **Workout Plan** in the second pass as well. Another option is to get the other mutually exclusive achievements while working toward **David and Goliath** (which I may recommend in the final guide writeup). To take the worse path, you simply need a wig and dress. Doing the minimum should ensure getting the worse path and making it quick to reset and take the better path. Additionally, you can get the Honeybee Inn mutually exclusive achievements right away, then work on the Don Corneo mutually exclusive achievements. Here is the order I did things in that seemed the most efficient: **A &$#% Up Moment**, reset then **Taking Out the Small Fry**, reset then **Group Bath** and **Dude (Looks Like a Lady)**. To ensure **Taking Out the Small Fry**, choose the first option twice when talking to the Dress Shop owner in the bar and he'll give you the Cotton Dress, ensuring Tifa is chosen by Don Corneo no matter how you do at the squats minigame. **Taking Out the Small Fry** unlocks after defeating Scotch and Lackeys (the second fight). The Honeybee Inn achievements are named after the rooms that you can enter. You'll want to go to the Group Room for getting Don Corneo to take Cloud. To get the best dress, choose the second option twice when talking to the Dress Shop owner. Out-squat in the gym to get the Blonde Wig. Get the Diamond Tiara from the materia shop owner by listening to their request, staying at the inn, getting the 200 gil item, and going back to the materia shop. Get the Sexy Cologne by getting the pharmacy coupon from the diner (choose any meal and say "It was all right"), select the Digestive (third option), and giving it to the person in the bar's bathroom.

**Workout Plan:** (Minigame) Make a save prior to playing the squat game in the gym. Get a feel for the timing in practice if you wish (or use the actual game for practice and reset if you don't get it). If you don't make a mistake and keep a good pace, you should hit the goal of 20 squats easily by the time requirement.

**Deep in the Decadent Backyard:** (Treasure) There are eight items in total to pick up in Sector 6 and the sewers. However, you can only get the first six in the initial visit and the remaining two during events in Disc 2. So make sure your measurement is at 6/8 prior to entering the Shinra Building. The first item is an Ether on the floor of the dungeon in Corneo's mansion where Tifa is located. The second item depends on wether Cloud was chosen by Don Corneo or not. It's a Hyper or Phoenix Down, depending on the situation. When Cloud is chosen, make sure to pick up the Hyper located behind Don Corneo's bed before talking to him! You have one other chance to get it before trying to leave his bedroom and falling down into the sewers as well. Item three is a Potion on the left after falling into the sewer. You can grab it before or after the boss fight. The fourth item is the Steal materia on the way through the sewers right after the boss fight.

**The Wonders of the Base (cont'd):** While in the Train Graveyard, we'll be grabbing more items for this achievement and completing it, provided that the two items in Sector 7's Beginner's Hall were obtained earlier. Go through the inside of the first train near the save crystal and check the barrel to find a Hi-Potion (item three). On top of that same train is another Hi-Potion (item four). Another barrel to the north has an echo screen (item five). Enter another train on the right and get the Potion inside (item six). Near the exit to the northern half of the graveyard is another Potion (item seven). Yet another Potion is to the left of the entrance after going around a train (item eight). Continue west around another train to another barrel, this one containing an Ether (item nine). Finally, a Hi-Potion (item ten) is found on top of a train between the two trains that can be moved to proceed to the graveyard's exit.

**Horseriders' Pride:** (Steal/Morph) This is obtainable while in the northern half of the Train Graveyard. Make sure to equip the Steal materia obtained from the sewers and then steal the Striking Staff from the Eligor monster. Since it is a rarer encounter than others in the area, it's possible that you may not find an Eligor before reaching the exit. If that is the case, circle around near the exit until one shows up. In my case, I had about six encounters and ran from them all while my team built up their limit gauges. When it showed, it took about six attempts to do the steal (Tifa was my stealer). Once I got the staff and achievement, I unleashed limits (Aerith healed with Healing Wind and used the Fire spell) and defeated the fiend.

**The Ballad of Heisenberg:** (Meme) Another chance to get some grenades is from the shopkeeper at the base of the pillar, hiding near some scrap on the left middle of the screen.

**Deep in the Decadent Backyard (cont'd):** The next item for this achievement is the Sense materia found in the playground after the Sector 7 plate fell. You can pick it up after Barret and Tifa join Cloud before heading to see Marlene at Aerith's house, or on the way back to Wall Market to get to the Shinra Building.

**Good Things Happen For Those Who Wait:** Now is the time to get the Turbo Ether and this achievement from the kid, if you didn't take their hidden money stash. Grab it before or after returning to Aerith's house (but certainly before climbing up to the Shinra Building).

**Moulin a Cafe (cont'd):** Here is your final chance to read the first Turtle Paradise notice in the Turbo Ether kid's room!

**The Ballad of Heisenberg:** (Meme) Yet another chance to get some grenades from the Sector 5 Slums weapon shop.

**Deep in the Decadent Backyard (cont'd):** Pick up the other item in Don Corneo's mansion (Phoenix Down/Hyper) to get the sixth item. The remaining two and this achievement will be earned when returning to Midgar in Disc 2.

**A Pimp's Destiny**: (Cutscene) Head down into the basement of the mansion to find Kotch tied down to the torture table. Free him and he'll tell you some stuff and the achievement will unlock as he runs off. This is missable because if you don't come here before the Wutai side quest, this event will be no longer available. A lot of people missed this one because the achievement is far down the list, after the Huge Materia quests. So, if you happen to have missed it, you could always get it during **David and Goliath** or if you have an old save like I did, go back and get it on your own. It doesn't affect any other quests so it isn't too big of a deal.

**Shinra Inc:** (Treasure) There are 32 items to find for this achievement. While climbing up the shining wire of hope to the Shinra Building, an Ether is obtained when using the last battery (accessible if you keep climbing past the swinging wire).

**The Elevator Champion/The Stairmaster:** (Mutually Exclusive) This is a perfect pair of achievements to split between the normal and **David and Goliath** runs. Storm the front and take the elevator in the normal run. Take the stairs for **David and Goliath**. Going in the front door also means that you can get the second Turtle's Paradise flyer for **Moulin a Cafe** and watch the ad for **Mako Motorworks**. I'm writing these notes taking the front door on the normal run. If you missed looking at the Turtle's Paradise flyer in this trip, like me even though I wrote this note to look at it, you have one more chance when you return to Midgar at the end of Disc 2!

**The Ballad of Heisenberg (cont'd):** If you didn't manage to buy a grenade or two, the Grenade Combatants you encounter in the first floor of the Shinra Building (if you opt to take the front door) can drop them.

**Mako Motorworks:** (Cutscene) Go up to the second floor and enter the museum/item shop area at the top right. Talk to the couple in front of the TV so they run away and then look at the TV to view the ad and get the achievement.

**The Elevator Champion:** This achievement unlocks once you reach the 59th floor via the elevator.

**Executive VIP:** (Treasure) Defeat the Mighty Grunts on the 59th floor to get Keycard 60 and the first of the five items for this achievement.

**Shinra Inc (cont'd):** After getting up to the 60th floor, you can head back down to the 59th and then go into the stairwell. Head down three screens and pick up an elixir for the second item. You can get this later, but it seems better to pick it up now.

**Without Arousing Suspicion:** (Minigame? Challenge?) This is a bit scary since there is no save point before this event. If you make a mistake, I'm not sure if the room resets if you are able to leave or not since I was able to get through this on my first try without getting an encounter. The first half is fairly simple since the guards pacing at the top are walking. The pair of guards on both sides follow a consistent pattern. Watch the pattern and leverage it to sneak past without being seen. The guards can only see when they are facing south. Once Cloud gets to the center, he signals to Barret and Tifa one at a time on when to run by. Press the Circle button at the moment the guards begin moving or when no guards are between the statues. The second set of guards run so the timing is tighter on when to signal. Just watch for them to start moving and press the button at the same time, being careful to not press the button too early. If you miss it on the normal run, you'll have to succeed during **David and Goliath** so there's a second opportunity if you'd rather wait.

**Executive VIP (cont'd):** Speak to the pacing person in the lounge to get Keycard 62.

**Top Quizzer:** (Minigame? Challenge?) Don't get help from the assistant and get the correct answer on the first try. The puzzle isn't too terribly difficult but there are plenty of guides out there, including [this one](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/faqs/71240/storyline-minigames#mayor-dominos-password), to tell you exactly how to figure out the answer easily. The correct way to play is to find the book that doesn't belong in each area of the library and the number on the book identifies the letter as part of the password. After completing the puzzle and providing the correct password, you'll get Keycard 65 (the third for **Executive VIP**), and the third item for **Shinra Inc** as well as this achievement for the first attempt. The Elemental materia from this achievement is also the first of three that will unlock the **The Possibility of Elemental Bliss** achievement.

**Shinra Inc (cont'd):** On the 63rd floor is a game where you can only open three doors to get three coupons. Follow the outer path around to the north and open the last door at the top heading left. Go to the end of the hallway and open the final door heading down. Enter the room to the left to get Coupon A. Enter the vent and go to the next room that had Coupon B in a bag. Open the final door to your left to get Coupon C and return to the machine to exchange it for a Star Pendant, Four Slots armor, and an All materia. Note that this only counts for one item in the counter for this achievement. Note that there is a save crystal on the next floor that you can access, in case you are concerned about the puzzle.

**Shinra Inc (cont'd):** On the 64th floor is a locker room. Open the two unlocked lockers (right side first and second rows) to get a Phoenix Down and Ether (items five and six). Make sure to examine the megaphone in another locker (third row left side) though Cloud won't pick it up and buy the "Shinra Gym Special Drink" in the vending machine and BANG on it when it doesn't dispense the drink to set up future items for this achievement on Disc 2.

**Executive VIP (cont'd):** Assemble the Midgar model to get Keycard 66. Only one remains!

**Battle Tested Blade:** (Steal/Morph) The SOLDIER:3rd enemies on the 67th floor are the first opportunity to steal the Hardedge. Make sure to get this as soon as you can.

**Shinra Inc (cont'd):** On the 67th floor, you'll find Poison materia in a chest near the save crystal (item seven). After the fight with Sample: H0512 on the 68th floor, collect the Enemy Skill materia (item eight) which also awards **The Way of the Monster** and credit toward the first of the four materia needed for **The Possibility of Beastmastery**. Climb the stairs in the south of the lab to collect two potions on the walkway (item nine and ten).

**Executive VIP (cont'd):** Speak to the person north of the two potions on the lab walkway to get Keycard 68 and unlock the achievement.

**Fluss der Liebe:** (Cutscene) You can start preparing for this cutscene to be available by talking to Tifa in your shared jail cell repeatedly. You gain +1 affinity point for each time you say "Leave it to me" to her. I recommend keeping track of the amount of times so that you have an idea of how much you need to buff up Barret for the Gold Saucer date to get **Acoustic Fireworks**. However, this may be something to save for **David and Goliath**... Hmmm... It may be easier to do that instead. [This guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/faqs/2385) provides details of actions and responses throughout the game and their associated affinity changes. Yeah, I'm going to split it off between runs rather than try to get both in one run. So, I spoke to Tifa a ton here since I want to make sure I have over 50 affinity points near the end of the game. Using fast forward, I triggered the conversation and affinity gain 120 times. I'm sure it'll work out great!

**Shinra Inc (cont'd):** After getting out of jail, follow the blood trail toward two more potions (items 11 and 12). It looks like this is the last two items for now until Disc 2.

**The Ballad of Heisenberg (cont'd):** Time to pay the grenade fee and get this silly achievement... Throw one during the Rufus fight.

**Nuclear Cuttery:** (Steal/Morph) The Custom Sweeper is found in the area surrounding Midgar. Steal the Atomic Scissors from them.

**Just a Friendly Pantyraid:** (Cutscene) Make sure to check the dresser in Tifa's room during the flashback event.

**Strago's Tribute:** (Materia? Not sure of the category yet...) The first enemy skill can be obtained from the Custom Sweeper as well: Matra Magic.

**The Possibility of Elemental Bliss:** (Materia?) During the flashback sequence, you can get an Elemental materia later on by checking Tifa's piano and saying "Yeah, I jammed on it" (second option). Play a few notes as well, just be sure.

**Vivo Revenis**: (Cutscene?) Apparently there is a bug involving the Kalm flashback sequence and an appearance by the subject of this achievement in the church in Midgar's Sector 5 during Disc 2. If you talk to the Innkeeper in Nibelheim during the flashback and say "Let me know the situation of the town", it prevents the person from appearing in the church. I don't remember if I did talk to the innkeeper or not during my normal run. If the person does not appear in the church, then I will need to put this off until my **David and Goliath** playthrough. I'd rather not, but it is possible. I just want to highlight this problem to make sure others are aware to be cautious with the flashback sequence.

**On the Outskirts:** (Treasure) There are 14 items to find across the three locations. The first is found in the inn at Kalm after the flashback event. Open the cabinet on the second floor near the stairs five times to get the megalixir. An Ether is in the house next to the inn in a door under the stairs (item two). The next house over has another Ether in a wardrobe on the second floor (item three). Yet another house over has a Guard Source in the wardrobe next to a child complaining about their brother on the second floor (item four). The circular stairs in the rear of the same house has the Peacemaker weapon in a chest for Vincent (item five). On the opposite side of the town square is another house with another Ether in a door under the stairs (item six). Once you arrive at the Chocobo Ranch, talk to the Chocobo right at the entrance and say "Wark" (first option) to get the Choco/Mog materia (item seven), which also goes toward **The Possibility of Avian Power**.

**DJ Chubby C. vs Go Go Boco!:** (Materia? I guess?) There is a 1 in 16 chance of getting the Fat Chocobo appearance so it may be worth it to attempt to get this near Kalm, where the inn is cheap for MP restoration. You can pass around the materia as well to get more casts of the summon before needing to rest and recover. Or you can just play through the game and roll your luck at getting the Fat Chocobo on occasion. Fort Condor has a free rest area too, so that could be an even better spot to try and get this.

**Basilisk Run:** (Challenge) There are a lot of strategies out there to be able to defeat the Midgar Zolom and get the Beta enemy skill early in the game. Since the fiend respawns in the swamp after it is killed by the party, Beta is not missable. Using Barret's Mindblow limit break is a way to prevent Midgar Zolom from using Beta so that you can survive the fight. If you put the party in the back row, have a dedicated healer, and use magic to deal damage as well as inflicting poison with the Bio spell to deal damage over time. Getting the Sadness status is also beneficial to mitigate damage. The exact strategy I used was to cast Bio with Cloud to poison and do damage, Tifa used Matra Magic, and Barret healed and tanked while firing off Big Shots until the monster died.

**Strago's Tribute (cont'd):**
  - Getting Beta early is great and not too difficult to do though some patience and luck with timing is required (unless you grind levels). Make use of the Sadness status on the character with the Enemy Skill materia. Put Fire-Elemental linked materia on that character's armor as well. Placing a Talisman accessory can further reduce damage. Hit the Midgar Zolom with Bio to poison the fiend, use limits as they come up, and defend with the Enemy Skill materia equipped character. Once a character is ejected, Beta can occur as a counter attack. Once Beta is learned, cast it back. Midgar Zolom should die or be close to dying from poison. This took a few tries to get... Timing played a big part in this. Give it a few attempts and adjust strategy to attempt to bait the Beta attack while also having done enough damage to retaliate with Beta as well and knock out the remaining HP in one shot. I was able to succeed with Cloud at Level 14 with around 550 HP. On my successful attempt, when Beta hit, Cloud had 100-ish HP remaining and Midgar Zolom did another physical attack for about 80 HP before I could attack with Beta and win the fight.
  - L4 Suicide can be obtained from the Mu fiend found in the grass areas surrounding the Chocobo Ranch. You don't have to have a character at a level with a multiple of 4 to get the enemy skill. Once you find an encounter with a Mu, leave the Mu alone until it uses the skill. When you see the notification that you learned it, win the battle.
  - Chocobuckle is obtained from chocobos at critical health. Since we are at the Chocobo Ranch area, this is the first and best opportunity to get this enemy skill. The best way to do this is to use the L4 Suicide enemy skill you just learned on a chocobo so that it can counter with the move before it runs away! You could use a Mimett Green to keep the chocobo around for a bit and use Sense to see the level but that's slow and expensive to guess with. Chocobos are guaranteed to be a level at a multiple of four if it is accompanied by two Levikrons or two Elfadunks. When you see that enemy formation, place a Mimett green, use L4 Suicide, and the chocobo will counter with Chocobuckle on the Enemy Skill materia user. Note that you do have to use a Mimett Green because the chocobo will just run away if you use something less than that.
  - Flame Thrower can be obtained from an Ark Dragon in the Mythril Mine. This is just a matter of luck that the person with the Enemy Skill materia gets targeted.

**On the Outskirts (cont'd):** After entering the Mythril Mine, go to the right and pick up an Ether on the ground and tent in a chest (items eight and nine). Climb the vines near the stairs to grab a Long Range materia (item ten). Back at the entrance, head south and to the left to grab a chest with a Mind Source (item 11). After continuing down the path and chatting with the Turks, head north through the archway to find an elixir in a chest and Hi-Potion on the ground (items 12 and 13). The last item and the achievement will be much later, on Disc 2, when you get a free Chocobo Lure materia at the Chocobo Ranch.

**A Tougher Grab:** (Steal/Morph) The Madouge is found in the Mythril Mine.

The Mythril Mine and the forests of the Junon area appear to be an ideal location to start unlocking Limit Breaks for characters. Getting encounters with large groups of enemies and using Beta are great for getting enemy kills on a character who is trying to get to a new Limit Break level. When trying to unlock a second limit break in a level, use Hyper to put that character in a Fury status and let a battle run to build up damage and limit gauge while other characters heal. Cloud can mostly be ignored for grinding since he is required in the party almost all the time. Later in the game, you can come here for killing lots of enemies quickly as well.

**Comes Right Back To You:** (Steal/Morph) Formula fiends are found in the plains of the Junon area, after leaving the Mythril Mine.

**Tower Defense 101:** (Minigame) This can be paired with **David and Goliath**. You start with the first game right after the Mythril Mine, the second one immediately after saving Priscilla, then the third after getting the Shiva materia from Priscilla. They are very close together and easily missed! I'm going to attempt to make it part of my normal playthrough unless I miss something... Since this is also Huge Materia related, if this is deferred to **David and Goliath**, you'd have to get all four Huge Materia in that run to get **WOW! They're HUGE!** so it is ideal to get it in the normal run.
  - The first event isn't terribly difficult. Mostly beasts are encountered with a couple of wyverns. Using attackers, a defender or two, and a couple of shooters should be more than enough to take out the enemies. You get Red XIII's Magic Comb weapon, which is nice for materia growth.

**Last Resort:** (Challenge) Just let the enemies during the Fort Condor tower defense game reach the top to fight CMD. Grand Horn. Defeat it and get this achievement. Doing this doesn't increment the measure for **Tower Defense 101** so only go for this if you don't care for getting that achievement or if you have saved prior to the minigame and can revert back to try the battle again.

**The Ninja Joins the Team:** (Side Quest?) The earliest you can get Yuffie is also right after the Mythril Mine. She can be found in any forest (chances are low initially so persistence is needed if she isn't showing up). After defeating the Mystery Ninja in battle, approach her and answer the following: "Not interested", "......petrified", "Wait a second!", "......that's right", and "Let's hurry on".

**Ravaging Reptile:** (Challenge) This may require some preparation to unlock limit breaks that will do enough damage as well as character levels. Or maybe just have Fury status and the HP to tank hits... Let's give it a shot. Yep! It took a couple of tries, but this strategy worked with Cloud, Yuffie (both level 18), and Barret (level 16). All characters had all materia removed, strongest weapons equipped (stolen from enemies), and carbon bangles for armor. Some luck was involved with limit breaks having crits and characters with lower HP getting bubbled, but I managed to get the boss on my sixth try. Fast forward makes repeated attempts inconsequential.

**Tower Defense 101 (cont'd):** The next two battles are right now!
  - The second event starts right after saving Priscilla and resting at the house that is offered. When you awake and the music for the parade has begun, leave Under Junon and head back to Fort Condor alone. The second event has a mix of barbarians, wyverns, and beasts. A mix of fighters, defenders, and shooters is more than enough. Swap attackers for fighters if you'd like, but the fighters are more than enough for the beasts at a cheaper cost. A Peace Ring accessory is your reward.
  - The third event will be available right after talking to Priscilla and receiving the Shiva materia (and getting the **A N-ice Gift** achievement), then heading down to the beach and getting the whistle. Again, Cloud goes to Fort Condor alone for this new tower defense battle. There is a good reward here for letting the enemy get to the top, but you don't get credit toward this achievement for that, so you'll have to win and get the lesser three ethers prize instead. I used the same strategy as the last battle, but needed a couple more units than before.

**The Imperial March:** (Minigame) There is a save crystal in the hallway just before going out to the parade. The march is a bit tricky to get right. Run in front of the row that you join, despite what the commander tell you and fall into the rank. Press the Circle button to salute the rifle in time with the other soldiers in the parade. It sounds like just mashing the button is even more helpful and just getting lined up is the key. Okay, mashing didn't really work for me. A rhythmic tapping was more effective at getting the rating up while lined up. This may take a couple of tries to get the feel for the event and get the >50% rating.

**Of Shores and Sea:** (Treasure) There are 24 items to find for this achievement. After going through the parade and re-entering the street, the last door is a housing area. Talk to the guard in the room to enter the Respectable Inn. An Enemy Skill materia is on the ground (item one) and would be the second of four for **The Possibility of Beastmastery**. Head out of the Respectable Inn and go up to the second floor. Grab the 1/35 Soldier toy, a Mind Source, and a Luck Source (items two through four). Go upstairs again and get the Power Source and Guard Source (items five and six). Go past a few screens to more doors and enter the third door (past the number "59" on the wall). There is a Speed Source on the floor in the first floor room (item seven). Go upstairs and grab another 1/35 Soldier toy (item eight). Make sure you have a Tranquilizer in your inventory before going to the dock. The item shop in Junon has them for sale.

**Sea Breeze Concerto:** (Minigame) Reset after getting this achievement to get the second place prize instead (HP Plus materia). The first place prize is a Force Stealer weapon, which will be obtained fairly soon and HP Plus is quite valuable to get leveled up. The game isn't terribly challenging to get right though. There is a save point at the nearby inn (the door that has the number "59" on the wall near it). Take advantage of the save to get a feel for how it works. It seems like if you are close on the timing, you'll get 10 points. If you are off a little bit, you'll get 5 points (if your timing is off a bit twice in a row, you'll see the 10 points, but it only increments in 10 points). This scoring system isn't exact, but it seems pretty close to what happens. However, you'll get no points if the timing is completely off, press the wrong button, or are facing the wrong direction (wrong facing overrides any button prompts that have good timing so realign yourself immediately). If you want the HP Plus (60-90 points) and are approaching 100, just don't do anything. The points never seem to go down. Also, the special finisher earns 30 points if timed decently and direction doesn't matter.

**Of Shores and Sea (cont'd):** On the ship, open the chest for an Ether (item nine). Talk to the sailor blocking access to a materia, who is Yuffie in disguise, and give her the Tranquilizer we needed. She'll move out of the way for that materia soon. After the alarm goes off and you form a party, you'll be able to get the All materia that Yuffie was blocking earlier (item ten). In the engine room, before approaching the Jenova fight, climb the ladder and grab the Wind Slash weapon from the chest (item 11). Notably, the Ifrit materia found after the Jenova fight does not count toward this achievement. Make sure you pick it up anyway for the **Summon Master** achievement later! We will revisit this achievement later on in Disc 2.

**Research and a Tan:** (Cutscene) Upon arriving in Costa del Sol, make sure Tifa is NOT in your party. If she was in your party on the cargo ship, you can PHS her out of the party by leaving town for the world map (this is necessary for the following event). Now, go to the beach and speak with Hojo to get this achievement.

**Do I Detect Some Tension?:** (Cutscene) After the Hojo cutscene, go to the door that is under the sign that says "Bar del sol" (Red XIII will be near the door if not in your party). Inside, you'll find Johnny and Tifa having a chat. Go into the room and Tifa asks you to give them some privacy. Talk to Tifa and after the conversation the achievement will unlock.

**Coal and Gold Miner:** (Treasure) There are 14 items to find for this achievement. Enter the first door across the bridge after leaving the Costa del Sol port and go downstairs into the cellar. Inside a chest is a fire ring accessory and there is a motor drive and Power Source on the ground (items one through three).

**Carbonated Comb:** (Steal/Morph) Bagnadrana are encountered in the Mt. Corel area. I found my first one on the second screen of the area. I also saw them at the reactor. Additionally, stock up on Right Arms by stealing them from Bombs at the large suspension bridge near the end of the area. They will be useful later.

**Coal and Gold Miner (cont'd):** After the reactor and running down the tracks of Mt. Corel, you'll see a save crystal. Use it! Now proceed to the fork and take the upper path of tracks. A weak point will fall out. DON'T JUMP OFF! If you do, reset and reload your save. While falling, hold left and repeatedly tap Circle. You grab onto scaffolding and climb to reach a Wizard Staff (item four). When you climb back out, the end of the upper track has a chest with a "W Machine Gun" weapon (item five). Now take the lower path and fall down a weak section again, holding right and tapping Circle. Climb the scaffolding and get a Star Pendant accessory (item six). You can now jump from any other weak track sections at this point. After reaching the next track junction, backtrack on the upper path to find a Turbo Ether and Transform materia (items seven and eight). Take the upper path to the right and lower the drawbridge. Past the cabin that lets you lower the drawbridge is a spot on the wall to climb. You'll find a nest. Take the treasure of ten Phoenix Downs and a battle (item nine) along with **Reverie of the Broken Phoenix** achievement. Head back to the lower track with the drawbridge, go around the bend, then take the left fork and enter a cave. Get the Tent from the treasure chest as well as the Mind Source and Power Source (items 10-12). In North Corel, enter the tent on the right near the lower right exit. An Ether is in a pot in the top right corner of the tent, though it is tricky to get to with the person pacing around back by it (item 13). That is the last item you can get until after the Gold Saucer date.

**Wrestling with Double Bass:** (Minigame) In Wonder Square's arm wrestling minigame, choose the Wrestler option. I recommend setting up turbo/auto-fire for the Circle button to cheese this, unless you are really good at mashing. You can get this on your first visit to Gold Saucer.

**Space Jam**: (Minigame) This game seemed intimidating at first but then I figured out a consistent method to get the hoop every time. Let go of the Circle button as the top of the ball lines up with the large hair spike on Cloud's head. I captured the moment in the super-dunk-lineup.png screenshot.

**Love Story**: (Minigame) A very simple minigame where you just give Mog the moogle some nuts. Feed him until he is happy twice to win and get the achievement. You can get this on your first visit to Gold Saucer.

**The Rules of the Road:** (Minigame) The goal is to get over 10,000 points and earn the Speed Source prize to get the achievement. Bikes come out in waves, three bikes each. Orange bikes will head right toward the truck while red bikes will try to avoid you and pull you away from the truck so other bikes (orange or red) can attack the truck. Try to stay near the truck and only pull away when red bikes need to be aggressively removed to start a new wave. If possible, use the orange bikes to create a chain reaction that takes out others, especially the red bikes. Staying near the truck will get orange bikes in a position where they can possibly hit other bikes as they slide away when hit by you. Overall, I don't think this is too tough to complete, but I can see how some may have problems. Ultimately, be aggressive while protecting the truck as much as possible and you'll eventually get this. You can get this on your first visit to Gold Saucer.

**Moulin a Cafe (cont'd)**: The third flyer is found in the Haunted Hotel to the right of the door to the hotel's item shop.

**Dragon's Run**: (Minigame) Getting 5000 points in the Speed Square minigame is no simple task. Many guides mention memorization of where targets appear so that you know where to position the cursor ahead of time, and that advice is definitely sound. Set up a save point at the Ropeway Station (costs 5GP to use though) so that you can practice the minigame as much as you want for only the one 10GP cost and resetting after each attempt. Setting up turbo/auto-fire for this game is also recommended to give your hands a break with repeated attempts. I had seen guides state that you should use a lower rate of triggering the Circle button, but a one frame rapid fire did the trick for me. As much as I loathe the site, the Fandom FF7 wiki page for [Speed Square](https://antifandom.com/finalfantasy/wiki/Speed_Square) does give a list of all the qualifying targets and their point values. Key targets to look out for:
  - the boulder near the end of the cactus/desert area: worth 200 points. It is hard to see without perhaps checking out a video of it's location, but I have a picture of it here (speed-square-boulder.png). About three-quarters of the way through the section, the upper wall of the canyon contains the boulder. Position the cursor on the right side, along the top of the wall and fire to eventually hit it.
  - Water wheel of steamboat: variable points. The steamboat appears after the first submarine jumps out of the water. Target down low and begin firing at the wheel but don't follow after it to keep getting more points. It's counterintuitive but it works well.
  - Balloons: 30 points each. There's a LOT of them, they pop with one shot, and they are grouped up to hit a bunch in one blast. You should be able to hit nearly all of them for a good helping of points.
  - Boss UFO: 1000 points. You can't miss it since the roller coaster stops at it. Center your cursor and just rapidly tap Circle (or use turbo/auto-fire). The UFO will back off and can't be hit for a little bit but will return once more to take fire until it blows up. As long as you keep your cursor in the center or slightly right of center, you'll hit it when it returns and it will go down with a high rate of maximum power shots.
  - Final spotlight: 200 points. As the roller coaster approaches the final turn, spotlights begin to turn upwards toward the sky. Move the cursor into the bottom right corner (I've seen people say bottom left as well, but I couldn't quite get the positioning there to hit it for some reason). Once you get in range of the spotlights, begin holding the Circle button (not turbo/auto-fire in this case!) and let your power drain. Hold it through the bend and eventually you'll destroy the spotlight and get the final points.

**Strago's Tribute (cont'd):** Death Claws can be found in the desert before fighting Dyne. They can use Laser, which can be learned on your Enemy Skill materia. Since you now have multiple of the materia, make sure you have learned it at least on the one that has learned the earlier skills to ensure that you get one materia with all the skills. Feel free to learn it on both, however.

**Summon Master**: (Materia) Make sure to pick up the Ramuh materia in the jockey locker room prior to the Chocobo Race!

**Tower Defense 101 (cont'd):** The fourth Fort Condor battle is available after getting out of Corel Prison and getting the buggy. Cross the ocean via Costa del Sol and return to Fort Condor to start the battle. This one is a bit more complicated than the previous two battles and has 10 more units (30 total) to defeat. This is the first fight where the guard you speak to in order to start the battle recommends using Fire Catapults. They seemed to work well at handling the increased amount of enemy units as long as you micromanage support attackers/defenders/shooters, but it is probably manageable just using them without the catapults. Make sure you have enough funds to handle adding additional units if you need them since pay-to-win is a legitimate strategy.

**Prayer**: (Characters? That might be a good category name for learning limits/getting ultimate weapons...) In order to get Great Gospel for Aerith, you'll need Mythril. To get some, there is a dude sleeping in a cave to the east of Junon. Talk to him when the number of battles you have won has matching odd numbers in the tens and ones digits: 133, 155, 177, etc. This is in preparation for being able to get the limit break once we have Tiny Bronco, but you might as well pick up the mythril now while here for Fort Condor.

**Strago's Tribute (cont'd):** Time to get more enemy skills!
  - White Wind: the Zemzelett, found in the Junon region, can be compelled to use the skill when Manipulate is used on them. It's probably useful to have both Enemy Skill materia equipped.
  - Big Guard: Beachplugs are found on the coast near Costa del Sol. Manipulate them to have them cast it on the party. I highly recommend getting this skill on both Enemy Skill materia!
  - Aqualung: A Harpy can be found in the desert surrounding the Gold Saucer while in the buggy. Use Big Guard for protection since the skill is basically Beta for the water element. Add Sadness effect if you are having trouble surviving as well. After the materia has learned it, kill the Harpy quickly (and/or heal!) because it will kill you if it uses the skill again.

**Double Kill!**: (Side Quest) Go to Gongaga, in the forest containing wreckage south of Gold Saucer, and defeat Reno and Rude. Save outside of the forest before hand, just in case. This can be missed if you go to Cosmo Canyon first, so make sure you stop at Gongaga first. The key to this is that they BOTH have to be defeated. If one goes down, the other will run away in a turn. So, bust out the big enemy skills: Aqualung and Beta! Use other multi-target spells or summons if you have them as well, or just defend if a character can't hit both at once. Both Turks have 2000 HP so you can track the damage and single target if they are getting close to 0 HP. Overall though, not too tough.

**Summon Master (cont'd)**: Pick up the Titan materia in the wreckage of the Gongaga reactor. After watching the cutscene with Scarlet and Tseng, walk by where she was standing and commenting on huge materia to find something shiny and choose "Reach for it" (second option). This is also the first item toward the **Forestry and Mountain Travel** Treasure achievement.

**Forestry and Mountain Travel**: (Treasure) There are 15 items for this achievement. Along the path heading toward Gongaga, there is a fork in the road. A yellow materia is found on the ground on the left fork, which is Deathblow materia (item two). The northwest building in Gongaga proper has a chest with an X-Potion (item three). In the house next to the inn is another chest, this one containing the White Megaphone weapon (item four).

**Strago's Tribute (cont'd)**: Look for the frog fiend called "Touch Me". Either manipulate or wait for it to use Frog Song on one or both Enemy Skill materia users to learn the skill and win the battle. I found one on the path outside of Gongaga, where the Deathblow materia is.

**Tower Defense 101 (cont'd)**: DO NOT MOVE THE BUGGY NEAR COSMO CANYON!!! In order to not miss the fifth battle, you need to have donated 3000 gil, or do the events in Cosmo Canyon while leaving the buggy parked a distance away so that it doesn't break down. You can get pretty close with it breaking down. To be safe, I went up the path and got out at the turn back that leads to the village entrance, walking the rest of the way in.

**Acoustic Fireworks**: (Cutscene) If you intend to do the Gold Saucer date with Barret, you will need to have him in your party when you first enter Cosmo Canyon if you need to manipulate his affinity. When the party splits up, Barret will be in the room behind Tiger Lily's Weapon Shop. Save your game and then chat with Barret to discuss Avalanche. If you say "Go on" (first option), Barret gains +3 affinity. If you then say "Yeah, whatever..." (second option), you can leave the room and reenter to do the conversation over again. Repeat this, gaining +3 affinity each time, to quickly get Barret's affinity up high enough to go on the date with him. Again, this can be done either on the normal or **David and Goliath** playthrough.

**Forestry and Mountain Travel (cont'd)**: Go into the Cosmo Canyon inn and enter the inn's bedroom. Examine the refrigerator on the left to get an Elixir (item six? Where was item five then???).

**Moulin a Cafe (cont'd)**: Flyer #5 is found near the door next to the inn counter. Flyer #4 is in the Tiger Lily Weapon Shop, on the pole between the stairs and the shop counter.

**Tower Defense 101 (cont'd)**: Once you have joined up with Red XIII to go into the Gi Cave, you can leave Cosmo Canyon for the fifth battle at Fort Condor. Again, this will only work if you haven't let the buggy get damaged. You can also have paid 3000 gil ahead of time to allow them to fund the battle and get credit toward the achievement, but your money is best saved up for later battles when you can't get to Fort Condor. The guard in the shack that starts the battle has the same advice as from the fourth battle so deploy similar tactics as that one for this fifth.

**Strago's Tribute (cont'd)**: Gi Spector or Sneaky Step will use Death Sentence. You can manipulate them to ensure that the action is taken and used on the correct characters with the Enemy Skill materia.

Potential preparation for **June Bug** later: While in the Gi Cave, fighting Sneaky Steps have a chance of dropping M-Tentacles, which cast Bio3. If you have some Deadly Waste from your time in Midgar, those can be useful as well. Getting Materia Keeper poisoned is helpful in defeating it with only items on top of the damage the spells do, so having these two will help immensely.

**Forestry and Mountain Travel (cont'd)**: Open the hidden path north by breaking the third strange rock, then loop around to the left and south and pick up the Added Effect materia (item seven). This is very important to get as it is the only one in the game and defeating the boss locks this dungeon out from reentry. You'll need it for the **Support Master** achievement! Back in the room with the oil slicks and forking paths, open the two treasure chests to get the Black Megaphone weapon and an Ether (items eight and nine). Heading further north is a room with five paths. The second path from the right has an X-Potion in a chest (item ten). Double back and take the second path from the left. After the Stinger fight, head left and south and take a hidden path right to a chest with a Fairy Ring accessory (item 11). Finally, fight the final Stinger and go around the rock formation to the left to get a Turbo Ether in a chest (item 12). This is the last item until Disc 2 for this achievement. The Gravity materia found after defeating Gi Nattak does not count toward this.

**No One-Way Ticket**: (Challenge) You cannot use the instant death healing items and spells on Gi-Nattak. This means that you can use Hi-Potions and the Cure spells. Other possibilities are to use summons, Beta (for Gi Nattak), Ice spells (for the Soul Flames), and regular attacks. If you have multi-target Cure spells, make sure to save them for your party if needed by shifting to single target. There is no save crystal before the boss fight so prepare yourself prior to entering the door to the north past the third Stinger. Note that you can't use any of these items or spells AT ALL, not even on your own party. That complicates things considerably... Keep people healthy to avoid any characters dying or be aggressive and take out Gi Nattak quickly. I opted for the latter, ignoring the Soul Flames.

**Tower Defense 101 (cont'd)**: After the Gi Cave, the sixth battle is available at Fort Condor. Take the buggy back to Costa del Sol/Junon to get there and talk to the guard. He makes the same recommendation again as with battles four and five.

**Nibel Visitors**: (Treasure) There are 27 items to find for this achievement. Upon entering Nibelheim, go to the inn and it's backroom. A man in black robes is holding a Luck Source and gives it to you (item one). Another man in black robes is in the item shop next door, near the furnace to the right, giving you an Elixir (item two). In Tifa's old house, in the kitchen area is another man in black robes who gives you a Turbo Ether (item three). Upstairs, in Tifa's parents bedroom, a man in black robes gives you the Platinum Fist weapon (item four). You can play the Final Fantasy VII main theme on Tifa's piano, but the secret stash does not count toward the treasure achievement, so you can skip it. In the second floor of the house in the bottom left corner, talk to a kid in black robes near the top of the stairs to get another Luck Source (item five).

**Strago's Tribute (cont'd)**: Get into a fight with a Jersey inside Shinra Manor, who will potentially use ???? if not damaged. So just tank the spin attacks until the main Enemy Skill materia gets the skill added. The skill is not in the manipulate list, so you just have to be patient, unfortunately.

**Nibel Visitors (cont'd)**: The next set of items are found in Shinra Manor. While not required to enter now, you'll probably want to since Lost Number must be defeated on Disc 1 for the **True Workout** achievement, unless you are going for **David and Goliath** obviously. Go through the door on the right by the base of the stairs and to a room with another chest containing the Silver Megaphone weapon (item six). Head through the central door on the first floor and go right and up to the chest to find the Twin Viper weapon (item seven). Up on the second floor, head straight left to find a chest with the Enemy Launcher weapon (item eight).

More possible preparation for **June Bug**: Try to fight Mirages to get a Mirror drop from them.

**True Workout**: (Challenge) Open the safe and start the fight with Lost Number. The requirements for this battle are that you have to be on Disc 1 (so you will have lower levels and equipment, potentially) and that you must fight the physical attacking half of the creature midway through the fight. This means that you must use physical attacks during the first half of the fight until the boss turns purple. Once purple, follow up with magical based attacks. Your strongest spells at this point are Beta or Aqualung. Big Guard is a must here as well to mitigate damage AND get more turns in between Lost Number's attacks. There is NO primed achievement notification that I noticed during this fight, so if the achievement didn't unlock when you land the killing blow, reset and try again. The other condition is that you cannot have paralyzed the boss (I assume that Stop counts toward this as well). Make sure your attacks and magic don't have an added paralysis effect!

**Forbidden Memory (of a Forgotten Dream)**: (Characters?) Lost Number drops the Cosmo Memory item for Red XIII's final limit break. You may not have all prior limit breaks unlocked by this point. Additionally, there have been reports of issues with the achievement unlocking on discs earlier than Disc 3. So, make sure to save prior to using it. If I get all of Red's limit breaks prior to Disc 3, I'll try and see myself.

**Nibel Visitors (cont'd)**: Defeating Lost Number gives you the Key to the Basement (item nine). The Odin materia also drops out (item ten).

**The Norse God of Many Faces**: (Materia? Side Quest?) Pick up the Odin materia after defeating Lost Number.

**Nibel Visitors (cont'd)**: On the right side of the manor's second floor is a chest in the northern room with a Mind Source (item 11). Finally, in the library, after a discussion with Sephiroth, pick up the Destruct materia he throws at Cloud (item 12).

**A Dark Invitation**: (Materia? Side Quest?) Get the Destruct materia that Sephiroth throws at Cloud in the Shinra Manor basement library.

**Of Transformants and Brevity**: (Side Quest) Get Vincent to join your party. Using the Key to the Basement, talk to Vincent in his casket. Choose "Talk about Sephiroth" (second option). Talk to him again and choose "Who are you?" (second option). See Sephiroth in the library and then try to leave the basement. Vincent will stop you and ask to join the group, unlocking the achievement.

**Nibel Visitors (cont'd)**: While following the path through the Mt. Nibel area on the first screen, a split in the path heads up into the mountains to a chest with a Rune Blade weapon (item 13). Another split path is near the rope bridge, heading up into another set of mountains. Climb the winding paths to reach another chest with the Plus Barrette weapon (item 14).

**Treasure Hoard**: (Steal/Morph) After the rope bridge is a room with pipes and is also the room where Dragons can be first encountered. Steal the Gold Armlet from them for the achievement (and better armor for the whole party). If you are concerned about surviving, you can manipulate them and then steal, running away after getting the armor.

**Nibel Visitors (cont'd)**: Take the pipe labeled number 4 to get to a chest with All materia in it (item 15). Take the south exit (to the left of the Materia Keeper), jump down and enter the cave, and take the meandering path to reach a chest with an Elixir (item 16). In the room with the naturally occurring materia fountain (from the flashback), pick up the Elemental materia in the water (item 17), which is also the second of three toward unlocking **The Possibility of Elemental Bliss**. The next room has the Sniper CR weapon in a chest by taking the left path at a fork (item 18). Skip past the reactor to reenter the pipe room and lower the ladder. Climb back up to the pipes and there the one labeled number 2 to get the Powersoul weapon (item 19).

**June Bug**: (Challenge) Because the boss has Trine and you'll want it on at least one Enemy Skill materia, I recommend using the save crystal and re-fighting this boss after getting this achievement, so that you don't have to worry about trying to do both at once as well as keeping your item supply after the fact. However, if you do manage to get both at once, nice! If you followed my tip at the Gi Cave, you should have a few M-Tentacles, or even some Deadly Waste on you. These will be used to put Materia Keeper in a poison state. With 8400 HP, Materia Keeper will lose 262 HP for every poison tick. Use the remaining damage items to attack the boss. Using the poison damage only will prevent Materia Keeper from using Trine and healing itself so attack it with additional items only if you want to. If you happened to get a Mirror from Shinra Manor's Mirage enemies, use one to put Reflect on Materia Keeper to prevent it from curing itself and supplementing your own healing. If you have the Bolt Ring accessory from the old man who gives you Mythril near Junon, put that onto one character to ensure someone can survive and heal (preferably the one with the main Enemy Steal materia equipped). Use Lightning-Elemental materia on armor on another character as well to reduce damage. Back row all of your party. Sadness could help as well. Worst case, if you aren't able to proc poison with one or two Bio casting items and you don't have any other items to do the damage, just reset and try again until the poison status lands and then let the poison do the work while you defend.

**Nibel Visitors (cont'd)**: After Materia Keeper is killed, it drops a Counter materia on the ground (item 20).

This is a good point to continue to get Limit Breaks unlocked. Kyuvilduns can appear in packs of 5, sometimes with Twin Brains. You can double it up with getting more Gold Armlets from Dragons. Additionally, in the grasslands around Nibelheim and Rocket Town, you can come across packs of three Nibel Wolves. Killing one or two can permit them to call in a replacement and so you can rack up some kills that way as well.

**Gambling**: (Characters? Limit Breaks?) The easiest limit break based achievement to unlock. Just kill 40 enemies with Cait Sith to get the Slots limit break and this achievement.

**Last Moment**: (Characters?) Once you have Slots unlocked, you can get the Game Over technique and this achievement. These reels are very fast so it can be hard to read, even when trying to use the slots exploit or emulator pausing. However, the game has a 99%   chance to roll over the reel past the spot that would trigger Game Over. To get around this, making use of auto-fire or mashing Circle will force the game to stop the reel in the correct spot. Check out this video by 4-8Productions which explains it: https://youtu.be/44vNEiulxIc?t=500. Thanks to RA user [DEATHDragon](https://retroachievements.org/user/DEATHDragon) for pointing this out and the link to the video.

**Nerdy Hobby**: (Treasure) Speak with the old man a couple of times outside of the Rocket Town item shop to get the Yoshiyuki weapon. This is also item 21 for **Nibel Visitors**. This is missable because after a certain point in Disc 2 (not clear what event does it), the old man is no longer available or doesn't give the weapon any more. So make sure to get it on your first visit.

**Nibel Visitors (cont'd)**: In the rightmost house in Rocket Town, open the chest in the kitchen to get a Power Source (item 22). In the house north of that, there is a chest with the Drill Arm weapon (item 23).

**Tower Defense 101 (cont'd)**: It's time for the seventh battle at Fort Condor! A very inopportune time, you have to participate after walking out the back side of the house that the Drill Arm was in, the party remarks on the Tiny Bronco and speaks with Shera. This is the point that the Fort Condor battle becomes available and only until you have spoken to the "Captain": Cid. So the window is very small! Either have paid the 3000 gil ahead of time or make the long trek back to Fort Condor to participate. The journey back is another opportunity to unlock more limit breaks. The guard at the shack has new advice this time around, stating that you should deploy tri-stoners and that's it. The tri-stoners are helpful in protecting the three main lanes enemies can pass through, though shooters will be necessary for taking down wyverns. Add supporting fighters/attackers/defenders as necessary. By this point, if you've been working on building up your limit breaks, you'll probably have more than enough money to fund the necessary troops and win this battle.

**Poki no Tema**: (Challenge) Prepare by getting the limit gauge filled up on all characters. By this point, you should have Aerith's Fury Brand, so if you are concerned that your party won't be able to do 6000 HP of damage with three limit breaks or withstand the attacks to build up the gauges again, try using Fury Brand to get four limit breaks easily. As always, save before entering Rocket Town and initiating the fight in case things don't work right so that you can adjust your strategy. Another good candidate for the fight is Vincent's limit break since he automatically acts after transforming it won't count against the achievement's requirements. Vincent can just attack and everyone else stands by in the back row.

**Tower Defense 101 (cont'd)**: Sure enough, the eighth battle is available right after escaping in the Tiny Bronco! Getting there is much quicker now too. The hint provided by the guard in the shack is the same as the last battle as well. While I'm unsure of the number of enemy units, there does seem to be more of them than the previous battle.

**Prayer (cont'd)**: With the Tiny Bronco and the Mythril, you can also pick up the Great Gospel item at the arms dealer's place near Gongaga. After giving the dealer the Mythril, you can go upstairs to the opening on the wall to get the limit break item. Aerith won't be able to use it unless she has all prior limit breaks unlocked however. I got them all prior to Rocket Town and was able to unlock Great Gospel once I got the item, along with the achievement. Getting this will make **Battle Symphony** easier.

**Strago's Tribute (cont'd)**: Time to get a couple more enemy skills while in Wutai
  - From where you can land with the Tiny Bronco, head to the patch of grass to the southeast. Find the Razor Weed encounter and manipulate it to use Magic Hammer on your Enemy Skill materia equipped characters and win the battle.
  - On the beach itself, get into a fight with an Adamantaimai. Manipulate it and use Death Force on your characters then win the battle. Also feel free to steal Adaman Bangles from them while they are manipulated!

**Moulin a Cafe (con't)**: When you enter Wutai, the Turtle's Paradise pub is across two bridges to the left. Make sure to check the sign outside the pub that mentions the publicity campaign to find the flyers throughout the world.

**Ancient and Leviathan Goods**: (Treasure) There are 28 items to find for this achievement. The Wutai item shop has a chest with an MP Absorb materia (item one). While you'll get credit for the achievement, you'll promptly lose the materia right after opening the chest. Heading toward the pagoda, enter the house on the right and then go into the room where you can rest. There is a hidden passage behind a curtain to the left that holds a chest with a Magic Shuriken (item two). Head back to the hallway outside the rest room and enter the next door. There is a hidden passage via a rotating wall to the south that leads to a chest with a Hairpin (item three).

**Moulin a Cafe (cont'd)**: After cornering Yuffie in the pot and the cutscene that follows, follow her downstairs. Before heading toward the purple carpet she is standing on, you'll find Turtle's Paradise flyer 6 on the wall next to the door, opposite the staircase. That should be all of the flyers! Head back to the Turtle's Paradise pub and speak with the bartender behind the counter to collect your reward and this achievement.

**Ancient and Leviathan Goods (cont'd)**: After tracking down Yuffie and witnessing her kidnapping, open the two chests to get a Swift Bolt and Elixir (items four and five). As you chase after Don Corneo, go north at two forks to find Rude in front of a cave, inside of which is a chest with a Dragoon Lance weapon (item six).

**Quite the Rapps-scallion**: This is required to be fought on Disc 1, so coming to Wutai right after getting the Tiny Bronco is a good idea. However, you are going to lose most or all of your materia. Stealing Adaman Bangles prior to this fight will help a lot (big defense improvement with only two materia slots). Having a lot of items on hand to provide healing, since you probably don't have any magic materia, will be necessary so stock up on Hi-Potions. Without magic and limits, all you have is attack and item. If you got T/S Bombs from the Flapbeats in the Gold Saucer area, these will be very effective against Rapps. It may be worth it to head back there and stock up before losing your materia as you progress through Wutai. They take 3000 HP on the first use(Rapps has 6000 HP). You can use another to knock off an additional 1500 HP, leaving that much left to take out with other attack items, such as the Fire Veil and Swift Bolts you can purchase at the Wutai item shop or Right Arms you may have stolen from Bombs, or physical weapon attacks. Rapps' Aero3 spell will do a ton of damage though, so make sure to heal after those attacks.

**Materia Junkie**: (Side Quest) This is missable because the events in Wutai will be locked out during Disc 3. Since you are near Wutai when you first get the Tiny Bronco, its a perfect time to get the quest done. The achievement is awarded after the cutscene where you get your materia back, along with the MP Absorb materia from the Wutai item shop chest. Some may prefer to do this after Temple of the Ancients, but with the **Ancient Steps Retraced** challenge achievement, it's good to knock out as many side quests as possible to get strong enough to do that challenge.

**Ancient and Leviathan Goods (cont'd)**: After finishing the Stolen Materia side quest for the **Materia Junkie** achievement, check the house/shed/whatever just below Yuffie's place that is full of cats. A cat that was blocking the path to the stairs has now moved. Go up stairs (press Circle at the base of the stairs to ascend), head toward the screen in the passage, and pick up the HP Absorb materia from the chest (item seven).

**Shuriken Contest/Ninja of the Gods**: (Side Quest/Challenge) Yuffie solos the best fighters in Wutai, including her father. To get Ninja of the Gods, this must be done during Disc 1 without leaving the Pagoda. 
  - My setup on Yuffie: Level 36. Razor Ring, Gold Armlet, Jem Ring first and White Cape or Headband later. Placed in back row with Sadness.
  - Materia: Poison, HP Plus x2, Counter Attack, Enemy Skill, Lightning+Elemental, Gravity+Elemental.
  - Items are the primary healing source.
  - Gorky: Use Magic Hammer twice to prevent his magic attacks. The dive kicks remove a quarter health so using ???? can do a lot of damage. If the script goes right, Gorky should only get a Barrier off before both Magic Hammers, use Dive Kick up to twice, and try to do spells every other round. Once you use two Magic Hammers, simply spam ???? three times to win. Heal up after the fight and head upstairs.
  - Shake: Easy. Use L4 Suicide. Shake will probably die to a counter attack. Otherwise, just attack afterword to win. Heal and proceed.
  - Checkov: This fight is why we have Jem Ring on first. It might be tempting to use Magic Hammer to remove their MP, but the Jem Ring protects Yuffie from Stare Down and wastes their turns. Checkov will resort to Absorb only when MP runs out, so let them just spam Stare Down while you knock down their health with attacks. You could try to land poison too, but the chance seems low and physical attacks did more damage for me. Heal and proceed.
  - Staniv: Yeah, L4 Suicide and win again. Heal and proceed.
  - Godo: Make sure you have swapped to White Cape or Headband for this fight. Headband is preferable because it protects against Sleep, but if you don't have it, the protection against Mini is good too. Cast Big Guard first thing for the haste benefit, then use Bio2 to try to get a poison proc'd on Godo. Use your limit breaks as they come up, then spells/summons/enemy skills/attacks as you wish. Godo's second phase involves him casting Cure2 as a counter. Magic Hammer can be used to eventually remove that capability from him, while restoring your own MP. ???? can also be helpful as your HP gets lower.
The achievements will be unlocked upon the end of the cutscene after defeating Godo.

**Create Your Fantasy**: (Characters?) Defeating Godo yields the All Creation limit break item. Once Yuffie has all prior limit breaks learned, you can use it to learn the limit break and get this achievement.

**Battle Symphony**: (Challenge) While in Gold Saucer to get the Keystone, you might as well take care of this challenge. You can wait until after the Temple of the Ancients, I suppose, but the handicaps can end up throwing a wrench in your plans anyway so give it a shot! Use the save spot in Gold Saucer or outside North Corel to prepare. Equip Aerith with the Fairy Tale and strongest armor (I used Edincoat) plus any accessory that you feel works best. I opted to use the White Cape to mitigate any potential Frog or Mini status. Having Great Gospel can really help in a pinch, so make sure you have it by now. For materia, magic materia is probably not the best, other than Heal (hopefully with Esuna by this point), Time (for Haste), and maybe Restore. Using HP Plus and Counter Attack with Long Range are a good bunch of Independent materia. Enemy Skill is an absolute must. Of course, keep in mind that any of these materia can get disabled in the slot machine handicaps so it is in your best interest to also have a stock of items to support the damage output and healing. Be flexible and ready for anything as luck plays a HUGE part in this. If you are well stocked in items though, you can probably brute force through it. I opted to use Sadness to reduce damage further in my playthrough and still got a filled up limit gauge when I took a big hit that might have killed me if not for Sadness. However, you can also put yourself in a Fury state to ensure you get more limit breaks if you wish. The final battle can be easy if you know the weaknesses (Ghirofelgo dies with one Laser, Dragon and Ying/Yang can be hit with L4 Suicide, Zuu is trickier unless you have some sort of Wind elemental damage but some Betas can take care of it). There is a more detailed guide here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ff7/comments/9aqxpo/easily_getting_omnislash_early_using_aerith_in/.

**Battlehardened Perk**: (Treasure/Missable) A woman appears at the bottom of the stairs at the entrance to the Battle Square after the events of Corel Prison. Talk to her and say "That's the idea" (first option) in response. If you say "Not interested" (second option), you will be locked out of her reward and this achievement (the achievement is not currently marked as missable). When you leave the Battle Square after having won eight battles in a row (not for Dio's Keystone though), talk to her again to receive the Sprint Shoes accessory and the achievement. I thought at first that she was supposed to appear inside the Battle Square area, not out in the front, so I marked where she is standing in battle-square-fan.png.

**A Top Brawler**: (Challenge) When doing the Battle Square fight for the Keystone, much of the strategy for Aerith's **Battle Symphony** challenge achievement apply here, except for Cloud. In fact, I just moved all of my materia over to Cloud, forgot to put him in the back row, didn't put Sadness on him, and still won (though it got close with a Dragon finale). Again, adapt to the situations that are put in front of you with the slots (and make use of the slot exploit for more desirable outcomes, if you wish) and finish all eight fights to win the extra accessories from Dio and the achievement.

**A Fine Frenzy**: (Characters?) You could make your way through the Battle Square now to get the Omnislash limit break item at this point in the game, but it may be better to wait until after getting the Highwind as the BP requirement is greatly reduced and the battles will be much easier with better equipment and materia. I recommend holding off.

**Acoustic Fireworks (cont'd)**: If you were raising affinity with Barret, now is the moment! Once you have the Keystone and can't leave Gold Saucer, you'll go on a date with the highest affinity character. If it's Barret, you'll get this achievement.

**Hotel Momento/Coal and Gold Miner**: (Treasure) After getting/losing the Keystone and having to stay at the hotel, make sure to open the "mini-fridge" or whatever that is to get an Elixir and both of these achievements (**Coal and Gold Miner** if you got all the other items earlier).

**Tower Defense 101 (cont'd)**: It's time for the ninth battle! The guard in the shack gives the same strategy yet again. As before, there are even more enemy units, but funds should be plentiful by this point to support the fight if you've been continuing to work on expanding your party's limit breaks.

***TODO***: I wrote a LOT of notes for the Temple of the Ancients challenge achievement, **Ancient Steps Retraced**. Go through them carefully to put together a more comprehensive guide on how to get this done.

Temple of the Ancients! Time for some divergence. I will split this up into two runs:
1. A normal run for completion, getting all items in the dungeon (for progress towards **Ancient and Leviathan Goods**) including the Bahamut materia (for **Dragons of Paradise**), and unlocking **The Unknown Within** progression achievement. Characters will continue to increase levels, materia levels, and unlock limit breaks as we go. This first run will be used to familiarize myself with the layout of the dungeon.
2. The **Ancient Steps Retraced** run, using only magic materia and not escaping or restoring MP. With knowledge of the dungeon layout, I can hopefully beeline directly for the end and get this achievement. Then I revert back to the normal run save file to continue through the game. If I have difficulties, I'll know that I need to take some time to improve my party prior to another attempt AND postpone it if I wish. It looks like this achievement requires a normal, non-**David and Goliath** run in order to have a chance to succeed. I ended up doing this run first, as the routing through the dungeon wasn't all that bad.
The **Ancient Steps Retraced** achievement was a cause for a LOT of people to be upset about the state of the FF7 RA set (along with **David and Goliath**). It has since been tweaked from it's original incarnation to what we have now. The gist of the strategy seems to be the following:
  - Use the Memory setting for the cursor. This will make extended fights much easier. You still have to deal with menuing initially for every encounter.
  - Use tier 1 spells only (MP usage doesn't scale to damage output)
  - One poster was around level 53 with the party they used (Cloud, Aerith, Cid). I'm going to try with a lower level party, maybe? Everyone in the back row with Sadness.
  - Pick up the Ribbon during the trip. Jem Ring on a second character. Ribbon may not be entirely necessary. Another user had Earring on Aerith, Jem Ring on the Esuna character, and Sprint Shoes/Chocobo Feather on the third.
  - Only magic materia so install as much of them as possible to raise MP and the Magic stat. Elemental magic doesn't matter too much though the character with Fire needs something else because of the Red Dragon fight. Heal materia with Esuna is helpful (preferably on the character with the Ribbon). At least one Restore materia on every character with one having Regen available. You will probably need to pick up more materia to fill all slots. Poison materia is a must! Time materia is a great one for boosting Magic and MP as well as having access to Slow (need one materia at level 2 then) which can be purchased in Gongaga or Rocket Town.
  - Buying a lot of Time materia will cost a lot of money (6000 gil per materia). Raising the funds is a great chance to gain more levels/limit breaks to increase efficiency. If you don't want to lose the money you spend, make a save prior to purchasing for the split between the main run and the challenge achievement run.
  - The big strategy will be to poison and then defend, letting the poison do the killing. Slow and methodical is the name of the game here.
  - You cannot use items at all, not even to heal HP.
  - RA user kevinmk760 seems to have a really good strategy laid out. They had excess MP, which leads me to believe that I can do this with lower levels (they were level 58 on most characters in their party).

  **Ancient Steps Retraced**: (Challenge) The achievement starts upon entering the maze, after using the Keystone. If you see the indicator that the achievement is primed, you'll know that you are properly equipped for the challenge. Set up your party outside the temple, save the game in a separate slot, and reset. After restarting, enter the temple and the maze, ensuring the achievement indicator is active. I used this map for navigating the maze as efficiently as possible to minimize encounters: https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/map/6880-temple-of-the-ancients-map. Get into a groove as you fight to poison an enemy with Bio, then defend every time, perhaps using fast forward to speed up ATB between inputs. Just use caution to not mash and accidentally use attack.
    - Maze room: With the reset and efficient movement through the maze, I only had one encounter with a Doorbull. That battle was in the archway just before the Turbo Ether that's in the middle of the path.
    - Boulder room: Move through the boulder gaps to avoid getting crushed then skip through the cutscene and head back from the pool to the staircase. I had no encounters here (not sure if there are any possible...). Don't talk to the NPC here to rest or save.
    - Clock room: Go through Door VI. Don't let the second hand knock you off. You could take Door V to get the Ribbon if you wish (it's a good idea to do so since Esuna removes Sadness). Some people also like to grab the Princess Guard from Door IIII but I think the Fairy Tale is more than enough. Again, I had no encounters here (not sure if any can happen...).
    - Door room: Go to the left along the ledge near where the person went into the door and press Circle to jump down, then enter the third door from the left. The door at the top will unlock. Head back to the left and jump down the ledge again and enter the rightmost door to go back to the top. Again, I had no encounters here (not sure if any can happen...). Don't save because you have to do this in one session.
    - Mural room/Red Dragon fight: The fiend has 6800 HP. Cast Bio to get it poisoned so it takes 212 HP per poison tick and then defend until it dies. Use Cure to heal as necessary. It'll take about 30-ish poison ticks for it to die. The red dragon breath is probably the most dangerous attack. Heal up after the fight with Cure before proceeding.
    - Leaving the temple: After learning what the Black Materia actually is, I got an encounter with 2 Ancient Dragons while leaving the mural room. In other attempts, I got lucky and had no encounter in the mural room. It may be that the extra steps for getting the Ribbon is skipping the encounter? I had no other encounters through the door room and clock room.
    - Demons Gate fight: Demon Rush only did nearly 400 HP of damage to party in back row with Sadness so it wasn't too big of a deal. Esuna removes Sadness, which can cause problems, so picking up the Ribbon is ideal. While Sadness is in effect, a character receives less than 500 HP from a rock falling on them, less than 400 HP from Demon Rush, and less than 300 HP from Cave-In. Add 200 HP damage to each of those when no longer afflicted with Sadness. Use this to help you determine when to cast Cure on your characters. These values applied to my characters' stats so your mileage may vary. Sometimes, Demons Gate will drop two rocks on the same turn. If it hits the same character, have any character heal the affected party member immediately. This was incredibly intense and highly satisfying when I was able to succeed. Having to pay careful attention to turn order, health, MP, and careful input made this challenge exciting, despite having to run back a few times due to mistakes I made from carelessness. Here is the character build that I used for this challenge in order to succeed:
      Cloud: Level 46
      - HP 1801; MP 584 (I had 108 at the end)
      - Murasame (Fire, Poison, Restore, Gravity, Earth)
      - Edincoat (Time x7)
      - Sprint Shoes (free Haste)
      Aerith: Level 40
      - HP 1402; MP 501 (I had 60-ish at the end)
      - Fairy Tale
      - Gold Armlet
      - White Cape; swapped to Ribbon (Ribbon for petrify protection)
      Cid: Level 42
      - HP 1368; MP 475 (I had 20-ish at the end)
      - Dragoon Lance (Lightning, Barrier, Restore, Destruct, Heal, Time x3)
      - Gold Armlet (Time x4)
      - Jem Ring (Petrify protection)

I goofed! I didn't get go into the rooms with enemies in the clock room! The enemies are in chests and opening those chests count! I'm glad I caught it when I did, despite having done the Fort Condor battle. Time to do the Temple of the Ancients again!

**Ancient and Leviathan Goods (cont'd)**: Follow the main path through the maze (again, the route from the map above is ideal to follow) and pick up the Trident weapon in the chest (item eight). Follow after the sage (Aerith calls them "spirit bodies") to the Mind Source and their shop that has a Silver Rifle weapon in a chest (items nine and ten). Return to the path and head under an archway to a Turbo Ether on the ground (item 11). While heading down the large staircase, there is Luck Plus materia to the left. You can grab it from the stairs so you don't have to run around to grab it (item 12). After going down a small set of vines, the next chest has a Rocket Punch weapon (item 13). Proceed through the rolling boulder room to the end, witness the cutscene, then grab the Morph materia (item 14). In the clock room, let the second hand knock you off to get to a chest with the Nail Bat weapon (item 15) and battle with two Ancient Dragons. Return to the clock room and align the minute and hour hand to make a path to door I, containing a chest with two Toxic Frogs and a Jemnezmy (item 16). Yeah, these monster-in-a-boxes are also included in the count! Now, align the clock to door III to fight two 8 Eyes in a box (item 17). Align the clock to door IIII for a chest with the Princess Guard (item 18). Align the hands for door V to get the Ribbon (item 19). Align to door VII for the Trumpet Shell weapon (item 20). Now align to door VIII for a Megalixir (item 21). Align the hands to door VI now and be done with the clock room! As we did for the **Ancient Steps Retraced** challenge, proceed through the door room puzzle but pick up the chest with the Work Gloves on the bottom ledge on the way (item 22). Make absolutely sure you are at a count of 22 before proceeding into the mural room!!!

**Dragons of Paradise**: (Materia/Treasure) I accidentally grabbed the Bahamut materia once after the Red Dragon battle during my **Ancient Steps Retraced** runs. Make sure you actually grab it during your normal run (item 23)!!

If you decided to wait to do Wutai, this is the perfect moment to head there with the weapons found in the Temple of the Ancients.
To reiterate what the treasure standings should be for **Ancient and Leviathan Goods**, there are 16 checks to get in the Temple of the Ancients. If you did Temple of the Ancients before Wutai, make sure you have 16 on the achievement measurement. If you don't, more than likely you skipped the two monster-in-a-box checks from the clock room. So, if you are at 14, double check those. If you went to Wutai first, you should have seven checks on the measurement PRIOR to entering the Temple of the Ancients. Once you have completed both events, you should have 23 out of 28: two remaining in Wutai and three in Mideel that are all obtainable in Disc 2.

**Tower Defense 101 (cont'd)**: Yeah, it's time for the tenth battle as well. Make sure to swing by Fort Condor to knock this out before proceeding to the northern continent. The guard in the shack provides a new hint that there are 40 enemy units this time. The waves are larger in size and the commander will join in the last wave so there is potential to need more units than before. Using a mix of tri-stoners with fire catapults is also helpful for handling wyverns and ground type enemy units. Once this battle is done, you are half way to completing this achievement! Also note that if you have been participating in every single battle up to this point and getting the post-minigame rewards, you'll get five X-Potions from this fight but the text box will be tiny and empty.

**Expert Archaeologist**: (Treasure/Mini Game) You can start to get some of the good treasure from the minigame upon your first arrival at Bone Village. You'll be getting the Lunar Harp for story purposes, but you can get some of those good treasure items as well. There are four to get in total (technically the last treasure is a "normal" treasure): Buntline, Megalixir, Mop, and Key to Sector 5. The Key to Sector 5 is unavailable until after the Lifestream event at Mideel. There is an excellent guide here that identifies the game mechanics and the possible locations: https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/map/6199-bone-village-treasure-map.

**Hasty Death**: (Challenge) In preparation for this achievement, it may be a good idea to get a few Dazers from the Boundfat enemies in the area outside of Bone Village and the Corral Valley area. Dazers will paralyze Jenova DEATH and reduce the number of turns they can take to help make the challenge easier.

**At the Heart of Gaea**: (Treasure) There are 27 items to find for this achievement. The first one is in the Sleeping Forest. Once the "forest awakes" (you have the Lunar Harp), you will see the Kjata materia floating around the trees (it's tough to see and it teleports around). Make sure you have room in your materia list to add it, then chase after it and grab it (item one).

**Tower Defense 101 (cont'd)**: Cool, battle 11 is now ready after waking the Sleeping Forest with the Lunar Harp. Time to head all the way back to Fort Condor again. The shack guard gives the same advice as the last battle (there are 40 enemy units) so follow the same strategy. You get the same reward from battle 10 as well (five X-Potions), along with the broken text box. We'll be back here again fairly soon too!

**At the Heart of Gaea (cont'd)**: As you enter the Corral Valley, head past the steps up to the log bridge and go under it instead. There is a chest that contains a Water Ring accessory (item two). You'll shortly enter the Forgotten Capital of the Ancients. At the fork near the entrance, go left. Enter the first building on the right and open the chest for a Magic Source (item three). Head north, enter the building, and down on the lower level is a chest with an Aurora Armlet (item four). Return to the entrance and go right. Enter the first building to the right and climb the ladder inside for a chest with a Guard Source (item five). Head north from the Guard Source building to another building. A chest on the ground floor has an Elixir (item six). Head upstairs and take a nap. After the cutscene, head back past the beds. The third Enemy Skill materia is behind the third bed. You can barely see the yellow materia behind the headboard (item seven).

**The Possibility of Beastmastery (cont'd)**: As stated, this is the third of four Enemy Skill materia toward this achievement. It doesn't have measurement toward it right now, but perhaps that will be improved on in the future. Just keep a hold of it, even if you don't make use of it to learn any new skills on it.

**Tower Defense 101 (cont'd)**: It's time. Head back to Fort Condor once again for the 12th battle. That nap was enough to cause Shinra forces to strike again. Aerith will have to wait! And just like last time, the advice from the shack guard is the same: fight 40 enemy units. So, follow the same strategy as before. And the prize is still five X-Potions with the broken text box.

**At the Heart of Gaea (cont'd)**: Back at the entrance again, head north now, heading further north into a building, and picking up the Comet materia at the top of the spiral inside (item eight).

### Disc 2

**Tower Defense 101 (cont'd)**: After tragedy, it's time to return to Fort Condor for battle 13. While this battle is available for a while, this is this most opportune moment, unfortunately, since you'll be far inland to be able to get easily back there. So get to Fort Condor now. Also, while there, ensure that you have donated at least 15000-18000 gil to the guard in the shack since Fort Condor will be inaccessible for five battles, battle 14-18. No advice will be given for this fight from the guard. The waves will be much more intense, but enemy units still tend to lump together in groups of similar types. Apply the appropriate counter unit while using fire catapults and tri-stoners to guard lanes and pressure enemies as they approach the kill zones of those stationary units. As usual though, if things go south and you have enough cash, pay-to-win! You'll receive three Elixirs after word, if you've fought every battle personally at this point. Again, make absolutely sure that Fort Condor has the funds to handle the next five battles on their own (at least 15000-18000 gil). Return to the Forgotten Capital afterword to proceed onward with the story.

**At the Heart of Gaea (cont'd)**: Upon returning to Forgotten City and heading past the rest area and continuing to the upper right, you'll come to stairs fashioned from spines of a giant shell. Go around that to get to a chest containing the Viper Halberd weapon (item nine). In the Corral Valley Cave, climb up the second fissure and jump out to the left. Climb up the next fissure and jump either way to jump back in and climb up to the chest with a Bolt Armlet (item ten). Head back down and jump to the right then climb down at the next fissure to a chest with the HypnoCrown (item 11). Climb back up all the way to the top this time where a chest with a Megalixir awaits on the right (item 12). Head left now, climb another fissure, then go down the ladder, picking up the Magic Plus materia on the ground (item 13). Head up the ladder all the way and enter the doorway where a chest with a Power Source awaits inside (item 14). In Icicle Inn town, go into the house just north of the Weapon Shop. Downstairs is a Turbo Ether on the floor near the bed (item 15).

**Reminiscence ~ Don't Forget the Child!** (Cutscene) Check out the equipment in this house with the Turbo Ether on the top floor. I'm not sure if you have to watch all of the videos or only the last one (I watched them all), but the achievement triggers when the guard shoots out the camera in the final video.

**At the Heart of Gaea (cont'd)**: The house in the lower right has two items on the floor, a Hero Drink and Vaccine (items 16 and 17). Take the Glacier Map as well (item 18). North of this house is the Inn. Head upstairs to pick up the X-Potion behind the window (item 19).

**D'oh You Missed**: (Minigame? Cutscene?) Make sure you saved before going to far into Icicle Inn as this event takes place within this town and you'll need to revert to your save if you inadvertently make a mistake. After talking to the woman at the far north end of town, Elena shows up. When the prompt shows up about holding a direction, hold left or right and press Circle. You'll move aside and earn the achievement. Of course, if you do make a mistake, you can always get this during **David and Goliath** as well.

**At the Heart of Gaea (cont'd)**: To proceed, you have to go into the center house and get the snowboard (item 20).

**Frozen Landscape**: (Treasure) When you snowboard down to the Great Glacier, take the left path twice. This will put you into arguably the most efficient location for getting all of the treasure of the area. Because of the nature of this area, you will probably pass out at least once trying to get all of the treasure and leave via the northern exit (where the red check is on the map). When you do pass out, you'll end up at the red check location (Holzoff's House) where you have an opportunity to save your game and rest. You can then proceed down into the windy snowfield and resume gathering the remaining treasures. There are seven items in total. Here is a good map, as recommended by a couple of people on this achievement's comments: https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/map/6673-great-glacier-map. Rather than describe how to get each item, I'll just list them in the order that I picked them up, but feel free to use the map and find your own way through to get each item.
  1. Mind Source (in a bag in the forest)
  2. Potion (on ice in the water)
  3. Safety Bit (in a cave on the lake after jumping on ice floes)
  4. Added Cut materia (on an angled path between a four way fork and the hot springs; hard to see on the ground midway on the screen just before the hot spring screen)
  5. All materia (in the windy snow field in a cave in the middle of the map)
  6. "Boss" fight with Snow and get the Alexander materia (Touch the hot spring, then proceed to the windy snowfield and head east to another cave containing the materia; I passed out JUST before entering the cave. Thankfully, you don't have to touch the hot spring again so you can just head back to here if you pass out before hand.)
  7. Elixir (in a cave west of the windy snowfield; you can get infinite Elixirs because the game doesn't force you to close the text box, but you must eventually pick it up to get credit for finding the item and getting the achievement)
Ice Golem battles seem to be causing issues with DuckStation when they use Cold Snap??? What the fuck... Battles with two Ice Golems wasn't loading in Cloud's sword and then it would get stuck trying to do the Cold Snap attack. I did a battle with one Ice Golem and it seemed fine. The only changes that I tried to make were to avoid fast forwarding and take my first battle in the forest path before the lake. I do think this is possibly an issue with DuckStation's fast forward issue as there have been minor glitches and soft locks throughout the game seemingly relating to fast forward...

**Now That Sticks!**: (Challenge) Fight a Malboro without having any resistances to status effects, let it use Bad Breath on you, and then win the battle. Easier said than done since everyone will be confused and asleep (on top of the other effects) and must wait for them to get knocked off of a character randomly. To then do any damage, you'll need to get rid of Frog status as well. If you happened to have some Remedies on hand, now is a great time to use them! So, while wandering around outside areas in Gaea's Cliff, ensure that you keep your health topped up between encounters. Also, make sure you have no status resistances. This can be done by going to the Status screen in the menu, and pressing Circle twice. If you have any statuses in the Defend area that are written in white letters, you need to remove the associated accessory or materia that gives that resistance to you. You'll know you are successful if it uses Bad Breath and the primed indicator for the achievement appears. So, remove that Ribbon! Of course, Bad Breath is ALSO an enemy skill, so ensure that at least your main Enemy Skill materia is equipped for **Strago's Tribute**. The chance of Malboro appearing increases as you proceed further up the cliff so it may not be right away. I recommend just trying to get an encounter with a Malboro in the first area, before proceeding too far up the cliff, so that you can take advantage of Holzoff's House.

**Strago's Tribute (cont'd)**: Bad Breath from the Malboro, as mentioned above. Additionally, as you explore the caves of the cliff, you'll want to encounter a Stilva to get their Magic Breath attack added to your Enemy Skill materia as well.

**At the Heart of Gaea (cont'd)**: Gaea's Cliff is an area that will be locked out so make absolutely sure that you have found all items before fighting Schizo! The good news is that if you found all of the items for the other areas previously (not counting Great Glacier), you'll unlock this achievement. After getting to the top of the first ascent and entering the cave, head up into a passage, go up the stairs then back down to the first room on the upper floor. Cross the bridge and walk straight into the wall to find a hidden room with a Ribbon in a chest (item 21). Heading a little farther north is another chest with a Javelin weapon (item 22). After another climb and in the next cave, head right immediately to pick up an Elixir in a chest(item 23). Take the upper right door and loop around outside (Malboro can be found here again...) and enter the cave again to find a chest with a Fire Armlet (item 24). Fight through the icicles (don't jump down!) to get to a chest on the other side with a Megalixir, or "Last Elixir" in this case (item 25). Head back either by jumping down or taking the outside path then climb up to the chest in the upper left with a Speed Source (item 26). Take the center door and open the chest with the Enhance Sword weapon (item 27) and the achievement.

**Forbidden Memory (of a Forgotten Dream) (cont'd)**: I ended up getting Red's final limit break unlocked to be able to use the Cosmo Memory item just before Schizo while grinding for Blue Dragons, so I saved at the save point and used it, just in case there was an issue. No problem! It unlocked just fine. Of course, this is Disc 2, and people reported issues on the other discs. So, keep that in mind to save prior to use of the item.

**A Buffer From the Start**: (Steal/Morph) Ensure that you have Steal materia equipped before this battle. If your Steal has leveled up and only has the Mug action, it may be worth while to master the materia and get a new Steal materia, if you are concerned about killing the boss before getting the steal and achievement. The right head is the one with the Protect Ring to steal. If you need help knowing which head is which, press Select to open up the help window that shows what your cursor is pointing at. It'll say "Schizo (Right)". It took quite a bit to get the steal to succeed so I focused attacks on the left head, healing as needed, while the thief would attempt stealing from the right. Honestly, it's probably fine with Mug too, unless your levels are really high. Thankfully there is a save crystal right near the fight so it isn't a huge deal.

**Deep Impact**: (Treasure) There are 42 items to find for this achievement, most of which aren't available until the end game (only four items are here). After having Tifa forced onto the team, you'll see a robed man fall off a cliff. Shortly after that is the Neo Bahamut materia on the ground, partially obscured by a rock, just before a save crystal (item one). Two more robed men get buffeted by the wind. Talking to them drops an Ether and Hi-Potion, but they don't count toward the achievement. Follow the winding path of robed men to a chest with the Kaiser Knuckles weapon (item two).

**Hasty Death (cont'd)**: Time to fight Jenova DEATH. Unfortunately, the save crystal is a few screens back so there is a bit of a run back if this doesn't work out right. If you got Dazers, use them to paralyze Jenova to reduce the number of turns she has. It may be a good idea to get limit breaks built up on all characters as well prior to the fight. Cloud's Meteorain or Omnislash and Tifa's reels can deal out a lot of the 25000 HP that you need to whittle down. I only needed one Dazers and all three characters to do their limit breaks to defeat the boss and get the achievement. There was questions on the achievement's comments about if each attack counts (Jenova can get a couple of attacks off seemingly on their first turn). It shouldn't matter though if you paralyze her as soon as possible and then unleash the strongest attacks. Slot reel manipulation is beneficial for Tifa's limit break and both limit breaks I mentioned for Cloud should be more than enough to take her out. There is a primed achievement indicator so if the battle does go too long and it disappears, then you'll know to reset and adjust your strategy for the next attempt. If you didn't get any Dazers, you can still backtrack for them, which is opportunity to gain more levels and limit breaks as well.

**Deep Impact (cont'd)**: After the battle and following cutscene, grab the MP Turbo materia directly in front of you (item three) then open the chest near the save crystal for a Poison Ring (item four). That's it for this achievement for now... If you don't have four items counted by the achievement, backtrack and find what you missed. You won't be back here again.

**Slap Fight**: (Minigame?) Mashing Circle was enough to "win" the slap fight. The win condition for this seems to be hitting Scarlet more than she can hit you until she says "God! I can't stand it!" and then her telling the guards to "Take her away." I got in 5 hits to her 2 hits on Tifa. It's a long way back if you lose so if you don't get it on the first run, perhaps trying again during **David and Goliath** if you don't want to go through all of the scenes again. I did another attempt using auto-fire of the Circle button at a 1 frame interval and I got hit by Scarlet 3 times but I still managed to win with 5.

**Tower Defense 101 (cont'd)**: We've been away and asleep for a while. As stated before, battles 14-18 have taken place while we were gone and now we are joining up for battle 19. Nearly done, especially since this is the last actual battle we can participate in (battle 20 is also forced to be missed). When you speak with the guard at the shack, they'll state that five battles have passed and your achievement's measurement will increase appropriately if you gave them the money to handle those five battles. When they tell you how much money is left over from your donations so as long as they have 3000 gil remaining, you'll be good to go for the next forced missed battle. The guard has no advice to give for this one and by this point, you should have more than enough money to throw at the problem if this gives you much difficulty. I used my usual strategy of deploying fire catapults and tri-stoners at the three lanes and then deploying the appropriate unit for the type of enemy was approaching the lane as it was needed. While the waves are much larger in size, it was still manageable with this strategy. Good luck! If you've been guiding every battle up to this point to victory, you'll get three Elixirs. And remember to ensure that the guard has **3000 gil** remaining to handle the 20th battle for you!

Time for some treasure clean up before progressing the story!

**The Possibility of Elemental Bliss/Nibel Visitors (cont'd)**: If you "jammed" on the piano as Cloud during the Kalm flashback, this is now the point that Tifa can get the Elemental materia from the piano (item 24). If you got the other two in the game, this will complete **The Possibility of Elemental Bliss**! Do make sure to get this as soon as you can as it will no longer be available after the Mideel event.

**Forestry and Mountain Travel (cont'd)**: The item shop in Cosmo Canyon has a side door to a back room open now. Go in there to get a Full Cure materia on a desk, and an Elixir and Magic Source in a bag on the floor (items 13-14). The last item will be Bahamut ZERO, which we will get after finding the Huge Materia.

**The Possibility of Beastmastery (cont'd)**: Go to the Chocobo Sage's house on the northern continent and talk to the Green Chocobo. The Enemy Skill materia it drops will (if you have picked up the other three materia in the past) unlock this achievement.

**The Possibility of Avian Power (cont'd)**: Getting that Enemy Skill materia from the Green Chocobo is the second of four items for this achievement. Also, at Bill's Chocobo Ranch, a second Chocobo Lure materia will be on the ground to the right from the entrance.

**On the Outskirts (cont'd)**: Picking up the Chocobo Lure also completes this achievement (item 14).

**Elemental Eater**: (Steal/Morph) Morphing a Cactuer is tricky because they are tough to hit. The key here is to use L4 Suicide, use Manipulate, then hit it with Morph to win and get the Tetra Elemental accessory.

**Strago's Tribute (cont'd)**: Fly to Goblin Island in the northeast of the map. Goblins are in the forest. Wait for them to Goblin Punch at least the character with the main Enemy Skill materia and then win the battle. Only six skills remain.

**Ancient and Leviathan Goods (cont'd)**: Before heading to Mideel, make sure you have at least one Mimett Green in your inventory. Also, while in town, do not proceed too far in (where the dog is in the middle of town). Go into a shop and talk to the person running around and their Chocobo. Give it the Mimett Green (the game refers to it as Samolen) and tickle it behind the ears to get a Contain materia (item 24). Also, make sure to talk to each shopkeeper and examine their wares to ensure that they are still available later, even if you don't need them right now.

**The Possibility of Avian Power (cont'd)**: The Contain materia from the chocobo in Mideel is the last of the four items for this achievement.

**A Gift From Another World?**: (Side quest) In the weapon shop in Mideel, examine the locked door in the back. Go to the accessory shop across the bridge and walk around the corner outside. Listen for a creaking floorboard as you walk. When found, examine the area to get a Beat-Up Useless Old Key. Return to the weapon shop and open the door to get the Curse Ring and this achievement.

**Ancient and Leviathan Goods (cont'd)**: Getting the Curse Ring is also item 25. After Tifa leaves and Cid takes over leadership duties, immediately return to Mideel and enter the house near where the dog distracted Tifa. Pick up the Elixir on the bed in there (item 26).

**Broken Mirror Reflection**: (Cutscene/Missable) Stop in the Mideel clinic and talk to Cloud a few times until he starts to say some of the lyrics to *Small Two of Pieces* ("A billion mirror fragments... small... light... taken... angel's... singing voices...") and "zeno... gias", unlocking this achievement.

REMEMBER: When going after the Huge Materia, do NOT go to Cosmo Canyon until you have all four! The **WOW! They're HUGE!** achievement requires having all four in your inventory at once.

**Crazy Train/Corel Heroes**: (Side quest/Missable) Head toward the Corel Reactor from North Corel (there is a save point on the tracks a couple screens from the reactor). After reaching the Corel reactor, a train departs with the Huge Materia that you have to board and stop before it collides with North Corel. 10 minutes are on the clock and we have to stop it before it hits 4:00 to get **Crazy Train**. Catch up to the train by alternating pressing Up and Triangle in a rhythm (don't mash). You can reach the Huge Materia train in about 10 seconds with efficiently quick inputs. There are five cars total, each with an encounter. Use quick inputs and strong spells to wrap up the fights as fast as possible. Do NOT use summons! Trine and Bolt3 are great for the first two fights and especially the fourth on the Eagle Gun. Aqualung is good on the third fight against Wolfmeister. Finally, the fifth car has a single Attack Squad and then you can stop the train. Mash through the results screens after battles and don't worry about healing. Just go go go! I got to the train engine at around 6:40-ish left on the clock and then the humorous attempt to stop the train took another 30 seconds or so.

**Final Catastrophe**: (Characters) After saving the town and staying in the inn for free, head down to the home just south of the inn. Talk to the person at the table who will hand over the Catastrophe limit break for Barret. By this point, you probably have all of his previous limit breaks unlocked so head out of town, save, then use it to learn the move and get the achievement.

**Tower Defense 101 (cont'd)**: When you go to Fort Condor for the Huge Materia battle, if you have completed every single battle, as well as the missed battles that you paid to ensure were covered, you'll get this achievement upon talking to the guard in the shack. Congratulations!

**The Path of the Condor**: (Side quest) If the guard at the shack has any money left over that you donated, you'll get it back now. Don't even bother with the minigame. Let the enemy units reach the top and then fight the CMD. Grand Horn boss. It is highly doubtful that you'd lose this battle if you have been working on getting all of your limit breaks and fighting as you go, but don't lose. Once you win, the condor's egg hatches and the Phoenix materia awaits. Return inside and speak to the old man at the table to get the Huge Materia and this achievement.

**Ultimate Curses!**: (Steal/Morph) Before entering Mideel after the two Huge Materia quests, ensure your party has a Steal materia equipped and make a save. Once the battle against Ultimate Weapon starts, you only have a few attempts to steal the Curse Ring. Revert to your save if you don't get it. If you aren't terribly concerned about keeping the ring after successfully getting the achievement, it might be good to revert the save again and then try to do as much damage as possible to Ultimate Weapon before it runs since the damage carries over and you'll want it to have less health for **Cut to the Chase**. Ultimate Weapon will leave after over 20000 HP damage has been dealt, so if you can go over that with your last attack, that'll help a lot. I had Cid with Dragon Dive which did 6 hits for about 8000 HP, then Red used Cosmo Memory for nearly 9500 HP, and finally Barret's Catastrophe did nearly 14000 HP damage, for a total of around 31500 HP. So Ultimate Weapon should have about 68500 HP remaining going into the next fight. This party was around level 53 and equipped with the crystal weapons purchased from Mideel.

### Open World Time

This is all about all of the side quests that are now available with Cloud back in the party. It can all be done in any order and some are available all the way to the end game. I'll break it up by areas, I think... Some of these can be delayed until **David and Goliath** I believe, though I feel like that run should be more of a streamlined experience and it's better to do as much as possible in the normal run.

**The Needle and the Damage Done**: (Challenge?) While you go through these side quests and get up in levels, you'll probably unlock this naturally with some limit break or something. Since you'll be wanting to maximize levels in order to get **Black Wing Metamorphosis** in your normal run, this achievement will come along naturally at some point.

#### Costa del Sol

**Mi Casa Su Casa**: (Characters? Side Quest?) This can actually be done as soon as you have 300k gil and are able to get to Costa del Sol. This was around the time that I was able to have the funds to make the purchase. My recommendation though is to save before hand, buy the house and get the achievement, and then revert the save because you don't really need to keep it and the money is better spent on other things.

#### Nibelheim

**Journeys on a Piano**: (Characters) Bring Tifa with you to Nibelheim and play the FF7 main theme on the piano (just like when getting Tifa's secret stash of 1 gil on the first visit here). Tifa finds a note from her old master along with the Final Heaven limit break manual. Use it when all her lower level limits are unlocked to learn the move and get the achievement.

**The Price of Freedom**: (Cutscene) Head to the Shinra Manor basement library to learn about what happened with Zack and Cloud and how they escaped.

**How Many Heavens Are There?** (Characters) A challenge to get all Yeah! icons on Tifa's limit break slots is available after getting the Final Heaven limit break. The comments on the achievement provide a bunch of guidance on how people have earned this and ideal ways to set up for multiple attempts. RA user [rlxldk](https://retroachievements.org/user/rlxldk) provided an excellent method to farm attempts if you are having trouble. Going to Cactus Island and put the whole team in the back row. Manipulate a Cactuer and put Resist on it (this prevents it from losing manipulate status), then Mini and Fury Tifa. Force the Cactuer to use 1000 Needles on Tifa to build the limit gauge and then try to get Yeah! on all spots of the slots. If you don't, repeat the process. The Cactuer won't die and you can keep healing Tifa. The slot exploit (using the square button to hide and pause the slots rolling) could work for you, though I have found it tough to determine where the Yeah! might be with this method. Pausing the emulator though is a valid option (Spacebar is the default on DuckStation). As RA user [Xeishiki](https://retroachievements.org/user/Xeishiki) states, using the emulator pause will enable you to still see the slot reel so that you can better time the button press. Getting the Yeah! at a position of 1 to 1-1/2 spots above the center should enable you to hold the Circle button and unpausing the emulator to land the Yeah! Take care not to mash because then that would cause later slots to stop as well. Emulator pausing can be a bit of a pain because hardcore mode mandates a delay in-between pauses so timing the pause will get difficult on the later reels. But, it's probably still much easier than just having to attempt rebuilding limit over and over again. It is really funny to watch a tiny Tifa piledrive a cactus though!

#### Bone Village/Midgar Sector 5

**Expert Archaeologist (cont'd)**: We can now get the last item and this achievement. Despite the achievement description, the last item (Key to Sector 5) is under the "normal treasure" category. As before, this map (https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/map/6199-bone-village-treasure-map) provides a great way to determine where and how to search for the key. Once it is dug up and pulled out of the chest, you'll get the achievement.

**Vivo Revenis (cont'd)**: The person did appear in the church after all. So either I didn't talk to the Nibelheim innkeeper during the Kalm flashback or I did and it didn't actually affect anything. Anyway, upon entering Midgar via the door with the Key to Sector 5 (despite the door having a giant "07" on it) you'll be right in front of the church. Go inside to see two kids and another person in the flower garden. Walk a little bit forward and that person disappears and the achievement unlocks.

**Deep in the Decadent Backyard (cont'd)/Canzone of Heart**: (Characters) Head to Wall Market with Cid and Tifa and enter the hut that says "ITEM" above the door. Try to use the vending machine again and instead of it shooting at you, Cid repairs it and Tifa gets her ultimate weapon (item seven) and this achievement.

**Deep in the Decadent Backyard (cont'd)/Hardly a Bargain**: (Treasure) In the Wall Market weapon shop, speak to the person who sold you the batteries needed for climbing up to the Shinra Building and they'll sell you the Sneak Glove accessory for 129k gil (item eight). Purchasing it will unlock both achievements, provided you found all other treasure. It is a bit odd that this was part of the **Deep in the Decadent Backyard** achievement, since the batteries were not...

#### Chocobo Breeding/Racing

Breeding chocobos can take place throughout the remainder of the game and will consume a lot of time. The goals are to get the Blue (**Tributary Pacer**), Green (**Rock Climber**), Black (**Terrain Galavanter**), and Gold chocobos (**Bird of All Trades**). Additionally, you'll want to use these chocobos to win races at the Gold Saucer and get **Scenic Chocobo Winner**, **Black Hawk Down**, **Primer Grade**, and **Elite Jockey** achievements. The Green or higher rank will be needed to reach the Ancient Forest (for **Madd Forest**). Various chocobos are required for exclusive materia such as Mime and Knights of the Round. All of these materia will be necessary for the five **[materia type] Master** achievements. There are plenty of guides for chocobo breeding strategies. I used this: https://chocobo-guide.mikestomb.com/. Definitely break up chocobo breeding between side and main quests as you go.
Another possibility is to use this guide: https://pastebin.com/raw/Z94pGCuj. I was having trouble with the RNG issues and getting a Blue Chocobo. So I started over and used this walkthrough and had duplicated the exact results outlined, netting me a racing capable Gold Chocobo!

Now you are ready to race, pick up the exclusive materia, and get Vincent's ultimate weapon and Chaos limit break! The Ancient Forest is also accessible, but I'm going to go there later on.

**The Caves of Altamira**: (Treasure/Materia) With the Gold Chocobo, you can now access the caves that contain unique materia: Mime (Command materia in Wutai), HP<->MP (Independent materia just north of Mt. Corel), Quadra Magic (Support materia found northwest of Mideel), and Knights of the Round (Summon materia in Round Island). You can pick these up with the other color chocobos as they're bred, but it's more convenient to get them all with the Gold.

**The Harbinger of Death/The Souls of Chaos**: (Side Quest/Characters?) With the Gold Chocobo, you can go behind a waterfall that is at an isolated lake just east of Nibelheim. Go there with Vincent and see a cutscene. Afterword, head out and get into 10 battles (if you don't have Vincent's level 3 limit break, this is a perfect time to unlock it). Return to the waterfall and pick up the Death Penalty weapon (and associated achievement) and Chaos limit break manual. If you meet the requirements, use the manual to unlock that limit break as well as it's achievement.

**Sweet Vengeance**: (Challenge/Missable) You need to get Vincent to learn Chaos before encountering Hojo in the Midgar Raid event coming soon. So if you still haven't unlocked the early limit breaks, do so soon-ish. Thankfully, Vincent's limit breaks only involve his kill count and he doesn't have to kill too many monsters compared to some other characters, so it doesn't take too long to do.

**Black Hawk Down**: (Minigame/Challenge) When you have a race against Joe and Teioh/Hyperion with your Gold Chocobo with maxed out stats, switch to manual mode as the race starts, hold both R shoulder buttons, then tap the Square button throughout the race. You'll blaze ahead and win. No sprinting required nor trying to block Joe and his bird. If you don't encounter Joe during the A rank races, you'll definitely see him in the S ranks while going for **Elite Jockey**. To max out stats, give your Gold Chocobo 30 Sylkis greens (as discussed in the various breeding guides).

**Scenic Chocobo Winner**: (Minigame/Challenge) Take your Gold Chocobo on the long course, switch to manual mode, and hold both R shoulder buttons the whole time. You'll cross the finish line with full stamina and this achievement. This is probably easier to do while the Gold is in the lower ranks.

**Primer Grade**: (Minigame) Just win races with your Gold Chocobo to promote them to the S rank.

**Elite Jockey**: (Minigame) Use the same strategy for racing against Joe and his bird for ten races in a row. I'm sure you'll even see Joe during some of these (he was in more than half of the races). You can do short course races for all of these. Make sure to take the Sneak Attack and Enemy Away materia if they are the gifts since this is the only place to get those. After ten races in a row, Ester/Esther will automatically give you the prize package and this achievement.

#### Gold Saucer

Battle Square has the final set of battles and prizes, including a reduced price for Omnislash. Speed Square has a new prize for 5000 points (you only need the points, the prize doesn't matter as far as achievements go). The prize vendor in Wonder Square has new stock as well (Gil and EXP Plus materia) for 3000 GP total. You may even have that much (or close to it) from the chocobo racing. Getting the two new materia is required for later achievements.

I personally opted to wait to do Gold Saucer stuff until later since I front loaded chocobo breeding and racing.

**A Fine Frenzy (cont'd)**: Now that the final battle set is available, the price of the Omnislash manual has reduced in price to 32000 BP. You can get this now or wait until after getting Ultima Weapon and doing the Special Battle or after the Torpedo Attack game opens (after Junon's Huge Materia quest) if you are trying to lump visits to Gold Saucer close together. You should probably buy the lifetime pass if you haven't already though so that you don't have to worry about spending the entrance fee.

### Disc 2 (cont'd)

**Around the World**: (Side Quest) While in the underwater passage, you'll have an opportunity to morph a Ghost Ship and the the Guide Book item for the Kalm Traveler that we'll meet in Disc 3. Might as well get it while we are here. I used L4 Suicide to reduce it's HP then attacked with Morph a couple of times to defeat it and get the Guide Book.

**Night of Seclusion**: (Challenge) Let me solo it... Probably the most difficult part of this is that you need to have the characters that are NOT participating in the battle dead prior to this fight. The catwalk over the submarines is a good spot as there are some strong-ish enemies that can take out the party, along with your own party members attacking each other. There is a save point just past the catwalk that you can then use to prepare and save your game. Another spot to knock out party members is the forced encounters prior to Carry Armor, after the save point. No matter what you decide, prepare your solo character with Knights of the Round. Unleash the knights upon Carry Armor and win. The Carry Armor may get a couple of attacks off prior to being able to press the win button, so make sure you have the HP and defense to handle those initial attacks.

**Of Shores and Sea (cont'd)**: After destroying Carry Armor, open the chest to the left and get the Battle Trumpet weapon (item 12). Upon switching screens to the close up view of the other submarine, head down the dock to open two chests with a Scimitar weapon and the very important Leviathan Scales (items 13 and 14). It is so important because the scales are needed for the last two items in Wutai.

**Backup Dive/Under the Sea**: (Mutually Exclusive) Getting the red submarine only happens if you fail to get the Huge Materia from the undersea reactor. Since the **David and Goliath** guide recommends winning the minigame and thus the Huge Materia, it doesn't seem like you can save **Backup Dive** for the low level challenge run. Thankfully, there is a save spot on the submarine! Make a save, fail the mission (run into mines), then go back into Junon and return to the path to the undersea reactor and take the door the dog and two guards are blocking to get the red submarine (and the **Backup Dive** achievement). Now reload the save and succeed instead, then head down to the southern islands in the submarine to find the sunken red submarine and pickup the Huge Materia and the **Under the Sea** achievement. It's a good idea to travel south on the surface of the water to avoid an inadvertent encounter with Emerald Weapon.

**Of Shores and Sea (cont'd)**: The Sunken Gelnika is found near the dock by the Gold Saucer. Travel there on the surface of the water, then submerge and you'll be nearby it. Enter the Gelnika and open the chest near the save crystal to get the Heaven's Cloud weapon (item 15). Head through the door to the right of the save crystal and follow the path to the chest with Escort Guard armor (item 16). Head downstairs and to the upper right corner to pick up the Double Cut materia (item 17). Now go to the upper left corner to open a chest hidden by the overhead piping with the Conformer weapon (item 18).

**Lost in the Depths**: (Characters) Yuffie's ultimate weapon is the Conformer that we just picked up in the sunken Gelnika. The weapon is idea for when you need to Morph enemies without the damage reduction (but not ideal for materia growth).

**Of Shores and Sea (cont'd)**: Return to the upper floor and head around the catwalk to the other chest in the room for a Megalixir (item 19).

**Twin Victory**: (Stealing) Save at the save crystal, have Steal materia equipped, and take the left door to find Reno and Rude waiting. The steal rate is pretty high, so you shouldn't have too much difficulty stealing these items. Once one is stolen, concentrate dealing damage on one and then knock down the other. If the damage they are dealing it too great, use Slow or Stop to help turn the tide. Unlike the last time, defeating one doesn't cause the other to run away within a turn so take your time to get the steals. Win with both items stolen and the achievement is yours.

**Of Shores and Sea (cont'd)**: In the Cargo Room, open the chest directly in front of you for another Megalixir (item 20). Head along the catwalk in the rear of the room to another chest with the Spirit Lance weapon (item 21). Down the stairs is the Hades summon materia near the helicopter wreckage (item 22). Finally, open the last two chests to the south to get the Outsider weapon and the Highwind limit break manual (items 23 and 24). The achievement unlocks after that.

**Captain of the Skies**: Use the Highwind limit break manual on Cid after all prior limits are unlocked to learn the move and get the achievement.

**Ancient and Leviathan Goods (cont'd)**: With the Leviathan Scales, return to the Da-Chao statue in Wutai to pick up the Steal as Well materia and Oritsuru weapon (items 27 and 28). This should unlock the achievement.

With the submarine, the last game in Gold Saucer is now unlocked. This is when I headed there to clean up the remaining activities.

**Sapphire Oceans**: (Minigame) A recreation of the battle for the Huge Materia in the Gold Saucer arcade game though there are quite a bit more targets to shoot down this time, seven in total. It's not terribly complicated though and you shouldn't have issues. Remember that you can use the R1 button to bring up an overhead view to help pinpoint where targets are if none are nearby.

**Torpedo**: (Minigame) Level 1 of the submarine game has 10 targets this time and they are getting more evasive. Again, make use of R1 to find where targets are when none are around. 10 minutes is more than enough time.

**Ballad of the Sea**: (Minigame) Only eight targets in Level 2 but they are much faster. You'll need to get closer to them for your torpedoes to hit them as they'll outspeed your shots.

**Aphrodite Oceanus**: (Minigame) Level 3 ups the difficulty a little by having 12 targets with many of them hiding down low between mountains. You'll need to search more. Additionally, as you begin to chase against enemy craft, they will move slowly so if you are going fast, you may actually pass them! If they aren't moving quickly, slow down yourself with with X button. I noticed that enemy subs were also taking more torpedoes to destroy them.

**A Journey Through Grand Oceans**: (Minigame) The final level of the submarine game has ten targets. About six yellow subs circle around a central mesa and the remaining red subs patrol around the outside areas. Be aggressive and you should win without problems.

**Frosty Wilderness**: (Minigame) Take a few trips down the course to learn the it. Get a feel for the controls and try to remember where the turns and balloons are. The balloons are the most important thing. If you can take the time to get the majority of the red balloons and all blue and green balloons, even if you come under the par time of 1:30, you'll get over 90 points. In the open portion with the sledding moogles, the balloons attempt to guide you through the safe lanes, including between the trees, though I found that going at max speed can result in bumping into a moogle or two. It took me about 6 runs, split over an overnight rest from the game, to get the target points and the achievement. Patience, skill, and a little bit of luck with the annoying moogles at the end will pay off.

**Thy Everlasting Winter Wind Blows**: (Minigame) I had ended up delaying this and the later course as a post game activity after giving it a few tries. When I went back to the slopes, I got this achievement on the second try. I was going to slow, thinking that I had two minutes to get the 30 points for the Time metric. I was at 23 points for that time, so that time I had was wrong. Turns out it is actual 1:45 for the 30 points. I managed to get down the slope on my winning run with 1:35, well ahead of the par time. I only had one bonk so Technique was 29 points. I managed to get most of the balloons, having 36 points. Aside from getting as many reds as you can, there is a blue balloon among some ice blocks after the "desert" section (it seems scary but is actually quite simple to get without bonking), and then there is a blue balloon when going down a fast and narrow slope with tall trees with a green balloon requiring a lot of speed to get the jump height needed to reach it at the end of the tree slope. Keep those three balloons in mind while taking time to brake slightly before sharp turns and you should have this in the bag.

**Crystalbound Chant/Holiday Frappe**: (Minigame) This course, the Crazy Course, has the 2:00 par time. While this course has two achievements, it's best to just focus on going for the 90 point challenge, since the 70 point achievement will come naturally enough. One thing to note is once you complete this course the first time, a yellow balloon will now appear shortly after the starting point. Collecting that starts Time Attack mode which will remove all of the balloons on a course. If you pick it up on accident, just reset and try again as you focus on learning the C course and it's balloon layout. Right at the beginning is a string of red balloons close together that lead to a big jump to a blue balloon. To get it, start on the outside of the slight turn and hook toward the red balloons. You'll want to be going at least 93 km/h or more when you jump to reach the blue balloon. If you missed the balloon because you didn't have enough height (something I had issues with), you are jumping too early. You want to jump just as the ramp ends! Inside the icicle cavern, the icicles that drop are the same in every attempt so learn where they will appear in your path. The evil part is the larger open areas just before red balloons that drop a large ice boulder (it's large and wide!) so give that wide berth. When you near the end, line up with the center of the opening and jump to catch the second blue balloon. You can't see it until outside of the cavern (I assume to simulate the idea of going back outside into sunlight and not being able to see initially). Near the end of the course are moogles rolling back and forth on snowballs. The last blue balloon is between a pair of moogles (if you have enough speed, you can bonk them without getting knocked over or losing Technique). The green balloon is close to the end between another two moogles that are just ahead and behind the balloon. In my winning run, I missed the last blue balloon and got all other high point balloons for 35 points, three bonks for 27 Technique points, and a time of 1:52 for 30 Time points after 8 attempts (not counting the multiple resets to learn how to jump for the first blue balloon). It seems daunting, but with enough runs in a row, you'll get this. Take your time going down the course and learning the lay of the land and you'll get this.

**Nibel Visitors (cont'd)**: Once in Rocket Town as part of getting the final Huge Materia, go in the weapon shop right near the entrance and open the chest in the bedroom to get a "Fourth Bracelet" armor (item 25). Head to the item shop and open the chest in the bedroom to get a Guard Source (item 26).

**First in Space**: (Side Quest/Missable) There is a passcode that must be input using the controller face buttons to get to the Huge Materia in the rocket. After making a first guess at the code, you'll have a three minute time limit with clues from Cid on how to solve the passcode needed to access it. Or, you can just enter the correct code on the first try, since it never changes: Circle, Square, X, X.

**WOW! They're HUGE! (cont'd)**: If you were able to get all four Huge Materia and never turned them into Cosmo Canyon as you got them, this achievement will be unlocked as soon as you get the last one in the rocket.

**Nibel Visitors (cont'd)/A Spaceman Came Travelling**: Return to Rocket Town after getting the rocket's Huge Materia and the events that follow. Speak to the old man outside of the item shop again three times to get the Venus Gospel weapon for Cid (item 27) and both of these achievements!

**Forestry and Mountain Travel (cont'd)/Ultimate Dragon**: After storing the Huge Materia in Bugenhagen's planetarium, examine the blue Huge Materia (you have to have saved all four Huge Materia for it to appear). If you have both Bahamut and Neo Bahamut, the Blue Huge Materia reacts and you get Bahamut ZERO (item 15) and both of these achievements.

**Nuclear Fusion**: (Side Quest) More than likely you don't meet the requirements at this point (except maybe for Command) but you can now get Master Materia from the Huge Materia, if you meet the requirements. Command is the easiest to get this with, because only seven materia need to be mastered to get it (Deathblow, Manipulate, Mime, Morph, Sense, Steal, and Throw). Note that doing this WILL consume the mastered materia so only do this if you haven't disposed of the cloned materia created from mastery, you've already earned the applicable **[Materia Type] Master** achievement, or you don't mind grinding TONS of AP on cloned materia. For achievement purposes, I would focus on the Command type as it is certainly the easiest and requires the least AP of all of the categories for the applicable materia: 430,000 AP. I'm waiting until after getting **Command Master** to get this achievement, personally.

**War: The White Weapon**: (Challenge) After the events with the Key of the Ancients and prior to boarding the Highwind, pick your party and fill up their limit break gauges. Ideally, pick characters that will do multiple hits with a limit break, or include Vincent. It's better to do this before Diamond Weapon begins its march on Midgar because, while there are encounters during the march, it's not an ideal time to build limit gauge and encounters in the Midgar area won't build it up very much at this point. If you are concerned that the party won't take out Diamond Weapon with three attacks, keep Fury status on them (though Vincent shouldn't need it once transformed). Also, if you have Counter materia equipped, remove it! A counter attack will nullify the achievement attempt. Once the battle begins, unleash the limits and win! If your limits don't take out the 30k HP, wait for characters to charge up limit gauge again without taking any actions at all and hope that they don't die before being able to unleash another limit break. I used Cloud's Meteorain, Cid's Dragon Dive, and Yuffie's All Creation to take it out in one round (though I did get a little bit lucky with crits). Any Vincent limit, Cloud's Omnislash (if you have it by now), and other multi-hit limit breaks will work great too. If you have trouble, revert to an earlier save and try a different combination. If you want to get Rising Sun, you'll need to do the battle again since you can't steal during this challenge.

**Cut to the Chase**: (Challenge) You can now fight the second battle against Ultimate Weapon, just before the raid on Midgar. Ultimate Weapon is first found at a newly formed crater near Junon. The goal here is to get it into its final phase of battle before it runs away by reducing it's HP to 20k or less. Even taking it all the way to 0 HP will cause it to run away to it's final battle location at Cosmo Canyon. If you did more than 20k HP damage during the first battle at Mideel, that damage carries over into this fight, so you'll have less work to do on this battle. You only have a few rounds to get HP to less than 20k before Ultimate Weapon will run away. So what attack do you have that will do a ton of damage in a single attack? That's right! Knights of the Round! I put Knights of the Round, Bahamut ZERO, and Neo Bahamut on separate characters and cued all three summons up at once. Bahamut ZERO went first, doing around 7.5k HP damage. Knights of the Round followed, doing 5.5k HP damage 13 times for a total of about 71.5k HP of damage to Ultimate Weapon. I would have been fine with just Knights of the Round, given that I did about 31.5k HP damage in the Mideel fight. But, it didn't hurt to have the other big damage dealers ready to go, just in case.

**Find Your Sword in this Land**: (Characters?) Finish the fight with Ultimate Weapon to get the Ultima Weapon for Cloud as well as this achievement. If you are feeling brave, try to get the killing blow with the character that has the most enemy skills on their Enemy Skill materia to get it one step closer to **Strago's Tribute**. Ultimate Weapon does Shadow Flare as it dies which will kill the recipient of the attack unless you put up a magic barrier first and have more than 5000 HP, but as long as the battle is won, the skill will be learned. If you don't get the skill on your materia though, that's okay as there are other opportunities later.

**A Fine Frenzy (cont'd)**: With Ultima Weapon, Ziedrich, a Ribbon, and the materia you have at this point, you are probably unstoppable at the Battle Square now. With that equipment, as well as 2 HP Plus materia that are mastered, Hades with Added Effect, Restore, Enemy Skill, Double Cut, and Long Range from the back row, Cloud had no problems. Use the slots exploit to get the reels how you want, though make sure to give yourself some challenge so that you can accrue a lot of BP per battle. Watch out for Ghost Ship in the last round though. It can eject you from battle, forfeiting all of your points for the attempt. Also, make sure that you have a healthy stock of GP prior to starting your Battle Square runs. If you run out of GP, you'll lose your BP if you have to leave the area. You can use this strategy to get the W-Summon and Speed Plus materia while you are here as well.

Midgar Raid time! There are many missables here! Need to be careful to not miss anything! I have noticed that DuckStation was having a hell of a time here so I tried to avoid using fast forward as much as possible but still ran into issues occasionally.

**Shinra Inc (cont'd)**: After parachuting in, head down the ladder and take the center path to get to chests with an Elixir and Megalixir (items 13 and 14). Head back to the start and go down the stairs to a ladder. Once at the bottom, go to the left and climb up the other ladder in the back to the Aegis Armlet (item 15). If you go to the right first, you'll miss out on this armor! Reset to a save if you miss it! After heading back to the right and falling down to the lower level, take the linear path to an air duct that drops you out to two chests: a Starlight Phone weapon on the left and Elixir on the right (items 16 and 17). Do NOT go up the stairs next to the Starlight Phone chest yet! Go down the ladder that is near the Elixir chest and move near the duct with "42" on the side then press Circle to jump down to it. At the top of the duct, take the ladder up to a chest with the Max Ray weapon (item 18). Head back down to the stairs by the Starlight Phone chest and go up to the save crystal. If you are unsure, don't overwrite the save spot from prior to entering this dungeon. Make sure you have 18 checks toward this achievement as well. Head south upon entering the tunnels. As you enter split paths, or junctions, you'll see numbers on the wall between the split paths. The first chest will be at Junction 3, containing a Power Source (item 19). Continuing down to Junction 2 has a chest with a Guard Source (item 20). Even further down in Junction 1 is two chests with Mind Source and Magic Source (items 21 and 22). Finally, at the end of the tunnel is the very excellent W-Item materia and a save crystal (item 23). Time to make a long trek back to the ladder and a rematch with the Turks!
***TODO***: Need to discuss the item count progress on the **Shinra Inc** achievement can vary because of the out of the way Elixir on the stairs. Something important to keep in mind, especially when item counts are important in this section full of missables!

**Triple Kill!**: (Challenge/Missable) This is a challenge achievement and missable because if any one of the Turks is killed, the other two will run right away. So you need to take them all out in one shot, hence the achievement name. If you did the Wutai side quest, you can also completely skip this battle by saying "No, let's not go" (second option) which would skip the achievement as well. So make sure to do the fight! Besides, you'll want to steal at least the Minerva Band from Elena, but the other two have the same steals from earlier battles and are just as good to get. The obvious play is Knights of the Round. I forgot to equip the summon prior to the fight and was trying to Aqualung to take them all out. Unfortunately, the damage wasn't enough because Reno's lower HP resulted in the battle ending when he died before the other two could be taken down. You could try to reduce Elena's and Rude's HP to near Reno's, but that's tricky unless you are manually adding up the damage. Just press the win button with Knights of the Round.

**Shinra Inc (cont'd)**: Time to return to Shinra Headquarters. Head up to Junction 8 (there is a red 8 on the wall between the two paths) and right after the Turks fight to get there. At Junction 0, take the left path, climb the ladder, and you'll be at the front of the Shinra building. Take the stairs to get an Elixir (if you didn't pick it up already despite my directions earlier) AND the Behemoth Horn weapon that is in an item bag (item 24). Take the elevator up to the 63rd floor. A room with one of the vending machine coupons has a new item bag with the Grow Lance weapon (item 25). On the 64th floor, BANG on the vending machine again and get a Mind Source and Speed Source (item 26 together). You'll only get this if you tried to buy the item from the machine and BANG'd on it before. Now go to the locker room and open the locker to the left on the third row again to get Cait Sith's ultimate weapon, HP Shout (item 27).

**Shout to the Top**: As stated above, the third row left side locker has Cait Sith's ultimate weapon inside. I wonder if this is Reeve's gym locker?

**Shinra Inc (cont'd)**: Head back down to the 1st floor. If you hadn't read Turtle Paradise Flyer #2 yet, this is the time to do so, as it is in the lobby by the rear elevators on the right. Head back up the stairs and enter the item shop on the left to open the two chests we couldn't open earlier: Pile Bunker and Master Fist weapons (items 28 and 29). Before leaving Shinra Headquarters, make sure you have 29 checks measured for this achievement!
**NOTE**: At this point, item counts will match up for sure.

**Shinra Inc (cont'd)**: Head back to Junction 8 and take the left path to continue on and fight Proud Clod. Head up the street to two chests with an Elixir and Mystile armor (items 30 and 31). At the save crystal, make sure to put Barret in the party. He is required here in order to obtain Missing Score, his ultimate weapon, in an upcoming chest, which will be about halfway up the stairs to the Sister Ray (item 32). It's been a very long road but congrats on unlocking this achievement!

**Trigger Happy Havoc**: As described above, open the chest halfway up the stairs to Sister Ray and the Hojo fight *with Barret in your party* to get Missing Score and this achievement.

**Sweet Vengeance (cont'd)**: After picking up Barret's ultimate weapon, it's time to prepare for a solo Hojo fight with Vincent. Ensure Vincent's limit gauge is full and kill off the other two party members in random encounters. Equip the Mystile armor for it's high evasion, the Death Penalty for it's attack power, and a Ribbon to avoid negative status effects (do they actually affect you while in Chaos form?). Place Vincent in the back row as well to reduce damage when attacks actually land. My Vincent was level 60 with 6224 HP and the above equipment and I survived with only 228 HP by the end of the fight! It was close (I forgot to put Vincent in the back row). Apparently, having any materia aside from Independent materia causes problems. Use the save crystal at the bottom of the ladder to make sure you can try again if the achievement fails. That wasn't an issue for me (I kept all of the the same materia on that Vincent had during the entire raid of Midgar) and the achievement unlocked, so maybe the issues around materia have been fixed.

**Fluss der Liebe (cont'd)**: After Hojo's death and everyone goes to visit with their reason for fighting, if you got your affinity with Tifa up high enough you'll get this scene and achievement. As stated earlier, the best moment to do that is when imprisoned in the Shinra Building by talking to Tifa repeatedly. If you did that, you probably had the date scene in Gold Saucer and now this. I split up the Barret date scene and this achievement between the two runs because I didn't want to interfere with the possibility of missing this scene and achievement by trying to do both in one run. Since I have to do two runs, might as well commit to one person rather than try to split things up. People have had success getting both achievements in one run, but that seems risky without knowing where your affinity points are at exactly. While that is possible to figure out, I leave that to you to decide. With having to do two runs anyway, no sense in risking it. That being said, I can see how this could work by getting Barret's affinity up high enough for the date scene at Gold Saucer while still having Tifa's affinity up enough for this scene.

### Disc 3

#### Cleanup after Disc Change

There are some things I still hadn't finished prior to the Midgar Raid, such as the Ancient Forest and the Battle Square's Special battle (though special battle can be made easier with some of the stuff in the Northern Crater). All of these things can be done at any time though. So perhaps move these notes to prior to the Midgar Raid so that they are marked at where they can be accomplished soonest.

**Madd Forest**: (Side Quest) Able to be completed as soon as you have a Green Chocobo, but is accessible by foot after Ultimate Weapon's defeat. There are seven items to obtain in your trip through the forest. In the first area, ignore everything and head over the hill to a fly trap with an item bag containing the Supershot ST weapon (item one). Make your way across the pitcher plants using insects as platforms, head across the gap and around a tree to another item bag with the Spring Gun Clip weapon (item two). On the second screen, solve the puzzle to get to the beehive and put it in the fly trap that is guarding the Slash All materia (item three). On the third screen, get two insects into the pitcher plants and climb up into the trees. Take the top route to the Typhon/Typoon materia, then head back and go down the tree to get to an item bag on the second screen with a Minerva Band armor (items four and five). Make your way to the cave on the right to get to the last two chests (items six and seven). All that is left to do is exit out the cave at the top and the achievement will unlock.

**The Gauntlet**: (Minigame) To participate in the Special Battle at the Battle Square, you have to have Ultima Weapon, learned Omnislash (not just acquired the manual), and purchased the W-Summon materia. Rather than use the Ziedrich this time, I equipped the Mystile on Cloud so I could leverage more materia. I still used Ultima Weapon and a Ribbon for the other equipment slots. A lot of the same materia as normal battles were kept, but I added MP Plus, Magic Plus, and Knights of the Round. Obviously, there is a lot of differentiation between setups and handicaps so your mileage may vary with how successful things are with the challenge. In my playthrough, the trickiest part was Unknown 3 as it was doing a TON of physical attack damage and just after accidentally taking 1/2 HP on the reels. The rest of the battles weren't anything too tough. Of course, the earlier you do this, the harder it will be and my first attempt at it on Disc 3 meant that I was well prepared for the challenge. Also, you probably don't have much need for BP at this point so it may be best to use the slots exploit to give yourself handicaps that have minimal effect, such as status effects, rather than take big BP handicaps like breaking equipment or removing materia. A first time successful finish nets you the Final Attack materia.

**Ascension to Cosmo Canyon**: (Characters?) Instead of going down into the crater at the start of Disc 3, why not head back to Cosmo Canyon? We still don't have Red XIII's ultimate weapon after all. Bring Red with you and you'll discover that something is wrong. After visiting with Bugenhagen, Red receives his Limited Moon weapon and this achievement. Safe travels, Bugenhagen...

***TODO***: For the **[Materia Type] Master** achievements, I think it might be a good idea to have a table that specifies the unique materia and their locations, disc availability, and any related achievements for getting them. It might also be good to have that be something that can be reached via a link to either this section of the guide and/or a separate page that outlines these important materia.

#### Entering Northern Crater

**Strago's Tribute (cont'd)**: Within the initial descent into the Northern Crater, you'll come across the Parasite, which you can manipulate to cast L5 Death on the party to learn it on the Enemy Skill materia. Your party members don't have to be at multiple of 5 level to learn it. Dark Dragons also make an appearance here and when manipulated can use Dragon Force on your Enemy Skill characters.

**Deep Impact (cont'd)**: It's been a while since we worked on this achievement so as a reminder, we have four items toward the 42 total. Upon arriving at the top of the Northern Crater, you'll come across a treasure chest right away with a Save Crystal item, which allows you to place a save crystal in this dungeon which we'll place in a more opportune point later (item five). Take care to ensure that you don't try to grab the chest before a rock falls as you head toward the chest. This can result in a bug that prevents the text box saying that you got the Save Crystal item from closing, which prevents it from going into your inventory and thus preventing getting this achievement. If this happens, reload a save and slow down. Continue down the spiraling descent to reach another chest that contains a Guard Source (item six). On the second screen, there are two paths heading downward and items on both sides. Make sure to grab the chest with a Power Source and a HP Absorb materia on the left ledge near the top (items seven and eight). Afterword, check the other chests with an Elixir, Guard Source, Mind Source and Magic Source (items 9-12). However you progressed, head down again to get to the next screen.

A note about the Save Crystal: Apparently issues can occur with the save spot that is spawned, preventing leaving the Northern Crater. This is obviously not ideal. The GameFAQs guide that I primarily used to navigate through the game and not miss any items noted that the third screen of the descent is one of the better locations, near the bottom exit of the screen. The glitch can occur in areas where the party splits, which would be the following screen, or in the swamp.

**Worth A Yoink**: (Stealing/Morph) The third screen of the descent is where Master Tonberry can first appear. Morph it into a Ribbon and the achievement unlocks. The biggest problem is that they have 44,444 HP and Morph reduces your damage output when used while Master Tonberry has very strong attacks because your kill count could be very high by this point or an Instant Death knife. Either use Stop to slow it down and take your time or get Yuffie in the fight with the Conformer to do Morph attacks at full damage.

**Deep Impact (cont'd)**: The third screen of the descent can be confusing to navigate with hidden holes and a network of caves. Jump down and head right to fall down a hole and open a chest for a Mind Source (item 13). Walk back right and jump up to the ledge above, cross over and jump down, entering the cave and getting a Megalixir in a chest (item 14). Leave the cave and go left, falling down several levels to a chest with a Hero Drink (item 15). Enter the cave and open the chest with a Guard Source (item 16). Follow the path upward to a hole along the right side that leads to a chest with a Power Source (item 17). Continuing on splits the party into three paths, and the route you interact with is where you send Cloud. I am taking the Left-Down path, the Rocky route.
- Rocky (Left-Down) path:
  - A chest is just near the start with a Remedy (item 18). Head right and jump across the stones to another chest with an Elixir (item 19). Head back to the previous chest and head down to open a chest with an X-Potion (item 20). On the next screen, head down and jump down the center to a chest with a Turbo Ether (item 21). Follow the path right to a chest with a Vaccine (item 22). Head to the left and look closely at an area where the Lifestream is brightest on the left edge of the screen to see a Magic Counter materia floating within (item 23). Next screen on, a chest is nearby with an X-Potion (item 24). Continue downward to another chest with a Turbo Ether (item 25). To the left is a Mega All materia in the Lifestream (item 26). Keep moving left to a chest with a Speed Source (item 27). Exit at the bottom left to the Bottom of the Crater. Now, head back up to where we first split up with the party and go down the Right path, the Graveyard.

**Strago's Tribute (cont'd)**: While in the Graveyard area, you'll encounter the Dragon Zombie, which uses the Pandora's Box enemy skill as a Final Attack (move used as they die) ONLY ONCE ON A SAVE FILE. Make absolutely sure that you at least have the Enemy Skill materia that is nearly fully filled up equipped to someone while going through this area to get this skill. If you don't have it prepared, run away from the battle. You can also learn Angel Whisper from a manipulated Pollensalta, and Death Dealer can use Roulette as a counter attack when it's HP is low (and will require luck to land on the correct target). This is it: the final three enemy skills. Once your materia will all of the skills learned thus far has learned these three, you will have a master Enemy Skill and this achievement!

**Deep Impact (cont'd)**: Time for the Graveyard (Right) path:
  - At the bottom of the spiral, drop down and pick up the Mystile in a chest and Elixir (items 28 and 29). Head farther down to the next screen (you can see the upcoming chest on the previous screen) and open the chest to get a Speed Source (item 30). Head down between the two "shells" to find a chest with a Tetra Elemental accessory (item 31). A path to the left has a chest with a Megalixir and a chest straight ahead to the exit of this screen has another Megalixir (items 32 and 33). Reaching the bottom of the crater, return to the Rocky path and make your way back up again, this time to where the party split a second time to the Upper-Left path, the Swamp.
- Swamp (Upper-Left) path:
  - You will become VERY familiar with this location when working on your **[Materia Type] Master** achievements! Take the lower path from the start around to a chest with a Magic Source (item 34). Return to the start and take the upper path, swim through the swamp and grab the Remedy in the chest before leaving to the next screen on the right (item 35). On the new screen, go along the lower path to reach a chest with a Hero Drink (item 36). Head left along the center path and then up and left to a chest in the back with a Vaccine (item 37). Go back to the fork and take the right path to a green Shield materia (item 38). Run straight down from the Shield materia to dive into the swamp and come out the water near a chest with an Imperial Guard (item 39). Go back into the water to be taken near the exit of this screen. In this final screen, a W-Magic materia is partially obscured by the green "leaves" (I guess?) north of the shining spot (item 40). Head down to that shining spot to get Counter materia (item 41). Leave to the left and you'll have returned to the Bottom of the Crater again.
- Bottom of the Crater:
  - All the paths converged here and on this final visit, open the final chest to get a Luck Source (item 42) and unlock this achievement. Congrats! Also note that, based on how you distributed your party, you may have some duplicated items when talking to the other characters that converge here because of entering this location and then returning to the start to take the other paths. The items that the other characters give a based on the location and who they are. Check out the [GameFAQs guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/faqs/71240/northern-crater) for more details on how that works.

#### Final Preparations

With everyone back, the Point of No Return is up ahead. This is the point to consider returning back to surface and wrapping up any remaining achievements and side quests, especially the Kalm Traveler (aka the superbosses) quest. If you are going to get the **Black Wing Metamorphosis** achievement, you'll need to have every character at level 99 so you might as well get your materia mastered while building up character levels too. With following this guide, you'll still have obtaining a master materia through materia fusion, completing the requirements of the **[Materia Type] Master** achievements, defeating Ruby and Emerald Weapon (including the associated challenge achievements) to complete the Kalm Traveler quest, and any miscellaneous achievements like snowboarding, Lucky 7s, and route specific achievements saved for **David and Goliath**.

Northern Crater Swamp Grind: Just start swapping out materia as they get mastered, putting in new materia that haven't been mastered yet. Seems pretty obvious, but it is easy to lose track of this, especially when making judicious use of fast forward. Speaking of fast forward, it makes the grind for materia mastery much less annoying. I concentrated on maximizing materia in slots rather than using triple or double growth equipment and don't feel like it took too long. Switching to triple or double growth equipment will make a lot more sense when trying to actually complete the **[Materia Type] Master** achievements. For now, use this opportunity to master every materia and gain levels on your party members. Perhaps you'll get Lucky 7s during your grind! W-Item is very helpful here for applying two Elixirs at once when two Magic Pots show up and also to duplicate said Elixirs. Movers are fairly rare but give the most AP of all encounters (2400AP) with two Magic Pots at a close second place (2000 AP). Make use of the save crystal you placed occasionally to save your progress. You'd hate to lose grind time to a mistake while having possibly poor stats while equipped with a lot of summon materia or HP<->MP materia and run into a Master Tonberry. As the number of materia remaining to master decreases, start to bring in the double and triple growth equipment to speed things along. Once materia have all been mastered, you'll more than likely still need to level up the remaining party members. Unfortunately, to swap characters, you'll need to leave the Northern Crater. The Swamp is still an ideal area to gain levels though, and you should now have a couple of EXP Plus materia to attach to characters to help them gain even more experience. Use Cloud's Apocalypse weapon to generate even more EXP Plus materia to help boost the remaining characters, though a two star level EXP Plus materia is the maximum boost to experience earned so it is only helpful to equip two of these materia if they are at only one star level. These materia also only affect active party members. So, once you have two EXP Plus materia at two star level or mastered, you won't need any more.

**Around the World (cont'd)**: You can get the Underwater materia from the Kalm Traveler iff you morphed a Ghost Ship into a Guide Book item while in the passage to the Underwater Reactor earlier AND have defeated Ultimate Weapon. If you are like me, you didn't turn this in until after having already gone down to Northern Crater. This is the last Independent materia which you'll need to do the **Independent Master** achievement. Thankfully it requires no AP so you don't have to grind it up for mastery. Of course, other than for the **Independent Master** and **Around the World** achievements, this materia will serve no purpose if you intend to get the Emerald Weapon challenge achievement: **Ocean Power**.

Once you have one of every materia in a category mastered, you can now fulfill the requirements of the achievement for the given materia type category. Equip all of the mastered materia in the category to available materia slots for any characters (except Yuffie and Vincent), including those not in the active party (it may even be ideal to use non-active characters based on the effects the materia have). Now, you have to master another materia in the category while all of these mastered materia are equipped. When that new materia is mastered, the achievement for the category will unlock. Ideally, you will want to pick a materia to master that is already nearly done earning AP or one of the materia that is the lowest AP required for mastery in the category.
- *Example*: In the Summon category, equip all mastered summon materia to characters not in your party (again, NOT Yuffie or Vincent). Equip a new Choco/Mog materia created from mastering to an active party member (Cloud's Apocalypse is the ideal candidate). Grind AP to master the materia. When Choco/Mog is mastered, the **Summon Master** achievement will unlock.
- *Why not Yuffie and Vincent?* With how complicated this achievement is, the rules to code the requirements would be very detailed. Rather than add checks for the optional characters, it is easier to use the required characters only. By this point in the game, you should have more than enough materia slots on the six mandatory characters to hold all of the mastered materia as well as the materia being mastered. The Magic materia category has the most materia in it's category but 21 materia still won't fill all of the slots when you use 6 slot weapons and armor on all six eligible characters (that's 72 slots, more than enough to even work on multiple achievements at once).
- *What about Underwater and Enemy Skill?* Yes, they don't earn AP. However, you need to have them equipped, even if they don't get "mastered" in the traditional sense.
- *Okay, I unlocked the first of these achievements!* Awesome! Now that you know that you have a good setup, it's time to rotate out materia for the next category. Rotate through until you have three categories left (assuming you are using Apocalypse to speed up mastery). You are nearly done!
- *This is overly complicated? What the fuck?!* Yeah, it is. However, this is probably the best way for the set creator to make the check that a player has mastered every materia in a given category, at the time of another materia reaching mastery. With a little bit of planning ahead of time, and **NOT using the Huge Materia for creating Master Materia before hand**, you can get these achievement without too much hassle.
- *It didn't unlock! I had all materia in a category equipped!* Double check. Go through the list, count the materia equipped, and ensure they are **NOT** on Yuffie and Vincent. make sure to **NOT** fast forward through the results screen when you get close to mastery.

**Nuclear Fusion (cont'd)**: If you took my advice and waited until completing all of the **[Materia Type] Master** achievement, now is a great time to do materia blending to get Master [type] materia! Return to the planetarium in Cosmo Canyon to interact with the Yellow, Green, and/or Red Huge Materia to fuse your mastered materia into Master Command/Magic/Summon materia.

**Lucky Number Slevin**: This is something that can happen naturally when you have characters with high HP and they get damaged that puts their HP at 7777. This can be manipulated to happen as well though. You can easily get it during the Emerald Weapon fight when a character has 9999 HP and two materia equipped (this nullifies the **Ocean Power** achievement however). Another way to manipulate it is to have a character with HP very close to 7777, fight a battle where monsters can be put to sleep or they do very minimal damage, shrink another party member with Mini, and chip a character down 1 HP at a time to 7777. If you are going to Mini someone, ensure they don't have protection against it, or it won't work.

If you are still needing to get all characters to level 99, this is an ideal time to do so. Keep on grinding down in The Swamp of the Northern Crater to get there. Magic Pots are the way to go. Make sure you are keeping your Elixir supply up with the W-Item glitch.
Getting at least three characters to level 99 will help with the Emerald Weapon fight. Cloud is probably level 99 already by now and Ruby Weapon is a solo battle so you can do that now as well. When you leave Northern Crater to swap characters that need to get to level 99, that can be a great opportunity to do one of the two superbosses...

Snowboard minigame is also available if you haven't finished it... like me...

**Ocean Power/Emerald Blues**: (Challenge/Side Quest) A lot of people seemed to want to use the source farming tricks to maximize stats. That would certainly make things easy, but I decided to just use the natural stat growth from leveling up as well as materia to do this fight. Remember to not use any ultimate weapons, equip any countering or absorb type materia, or use the Knights of the Round summon. Also make sure to not equip Underwater, Mime, or Final Attack materia. If you have a max HP of 9999, make sure to not have only 2 materia equipped or you could hit Lucky 7s, which will invalidate the achievement. Finally, if you are using Cait Sith for the fight, do not try to get Game Over. You'll know you successfully met the requirements if the achievement primed indicator appears at the start of the battle.
I put my team into Fury status so that Limit Breaks were frequent and usually queued up when Emerald Weapon's eyes activated. Since my stats are lower because of not farming sources, I made use of Hero Drinks to boost stats during the fight. W-Item is great for getting two Hero Drinks in a round. Four per character should be enough.
I opened with Hades to slow down Emerald Weapon while the other two W-Item'd Hero Drinks. When they hit four drinks, they helped the other character without W-Item drink up Hero Drinks as well. One character with Master Magic and Quadra Magic junctioned to it would quad cast Demi on Emerald Weapon while the other two used 4x Cut. Quad Demi casts are nice because they will do 9999 HP of damage each until Emerald Weapon is nearly defeated so it is a nice indication that you are close to winning the battle. If possible, limits were reserved for when the eyes activated so that they could be destroyed as soon as possible and avoid Aire Tam Storm. Megalixir and Elixir are the primary healing source. Be cautious and responsive to Emerald Weapon's attack script shifts while keeping health up and being aggressive to win. Also, if you have Master Command materia and the eyes open while no limits are ready, throwing gil is very effective at hitting everything for max damage. It won't be enough to take the eyes out, but it'll help speed up the process as a backup. Good luck!

**Desert Storm/Crimson Jazz**: (Challenge/Side Quest) Wow. This was much more difficult to figure out than Emerald Weapon. Ruby Weapon has very high stats which make hitting the thing difficult. It uses tentacles to surround you into a pincer attack. The tentacles use percentage based attacks to your HP and MP (that also cause status effects if you don't have a Ribbon) while Ruby Weapon itself uses magic based attacks, including Ultima and Shadow Flare. If you have more than one party member alive, Ruby Weapon will put the tentacles away (or not put them in the sand if you start with more than one character alive) and then basically eject a character at random until only one character remains. So it is ideal to only have one person alive at the start of the battle. Because of it's high stats, you may find that hits can be difficult to land, especially if under Fury status. Of course, none of this would be an issue really if you max your stats with source farming. That's no fun though. Let's continue using our party at max level with their given stats and materia to solve this problem.
I found Barret to be the ideal person to take on this battle. His ultimate weapon (we can use them for this challenge) deals more damage based on the AP earned by the materia attached to it. That means using Knights of the Round or Master Summon materia will greatly improve the damage output of the weapon. As stated earlier, Ribbon is a must because of the tentacles. Ziedrich is ideal armor because it reduces elemental damage and has a high evasion rate without materia slots. So we have eight slots to work with and want the maximum AP materia we can attach to it. Again, Knights of the Round or Master Summon should be attached (as long as we don't use the summon or Hades, the challenge remains active). The next highest AP is Magic Counter, however we can't use it because that materia is banned for the challenge. Following that is the W-Item, W-Magic, and W-Summon materia for next highest AP. W-Item is an excellent command to have anyway to quickly get Hero Drinks up AND recover from Ruby Weapon's attacks. Now for functional materia, we'll want mastered Double Cut to attack four times per round and Enemy Skill with Magic Hammer and Big Guard. For the last two slots, I put Luck and Speed Plus materia in to improve those stats for increased critical hit rate and improve the chance to land hits. When using items, make sure to NOT use Dazers or the challenge will be invalidated.
For the actual fight, start off the first two rounds with Hero Drinks x2. Next, cast Big Guard. Now you have to maintain a delicate balance of keeping the barriers up, using Magic Hammer to reduce Ruby Weapon's MP pool, and keeping your health up. If you get down below 4000 HP, you urgently need to heal as Ultima and Shadow Flare will do around nearly that much damage WHILE the barriers are up! They do MUCH more without having the barriers. The idea here is to survive long enough while helping Ruby Weapon burn their MP pool to start seeing the message "Ruby Weapon's skill power is used up". At this point, Ruby Weapon's enemy skills will only do around 800-1800 HP of damage. Still be attentive to barriers and your health, since the tentacles can take a lot of your health away. Now is the time to begin fighting back. Use limits (deals about 1600 HP damage x10 plus more with critical hits) and 4x Cut (about 9000 HP per hit or 9999 HP if a critical hit). Some of your 4x Cut attacks can miss, especially if you use Fury to try to get more limits. I noticed that I was missing a lot of attacks though, so I tried to use a Tranquilizer during the battle. My hit rate seemed to improve, but I was still in Fury status and couldn't get out of it. I don't know if that was a bug with the game or what but it did seem that I had the benefit of improved hit rate while also increasing limit gauge quickly.
This is a long, taxing fight. You have to be paying attention closely, especially in the first half while Ruby Weapon can cast spells. Take your time, rest and think if you need to while in a menu, and you'll come out victorious in the end while not having used sources to max stats. Good luck!

**Around the World (cont'd)**: Bring the spoils from the Emerald and Ruby Weapon fights to the Kalm Traveler to receive a Gold Chocobo (eh...) and Master Summon/Magic/Command materia (yo!). After the traveler gives you the gifts in trade, he departs and the achievement unlocks.

#### Point of No Return and Endgame

lets-mosey.png

As you descend to the bottom, you'll have a chance of random battles as you jump to every platform. On the second screen, you'll head toward a center platform. As you land on the center platform, before running toward the center with all of the cubes, set up the materia you want on every character via the Materia menu's Exchange menu (though you do have another opportunity later). Make sure Knights of the Round is attached to your initial descent party for the first phase of the final fight.

**Black Wing Metamorphosis**: (Challenge) To get the strongest possible form of Safer Sephiroth, you need to have every character, except Aerith, at level 99 (each one adds 30k HP and several points to Attack, Defense, Magic Attack, and Magic Defense stats), use Knights of the Round on Jenova Synthesis (adds 80k HP), and and don't kill Bizzaro Sephiroth's head during it's three part battle (each kill reduces HP up to 24,900 HP). These will also impact Bizzaro Sephiroth though I assume that we are largely concerned with Safer for this particular achievement. To avoid targeting the head of Bizzaro Sephiroth, multi-target spells, skills, and commands cannot be used. Do not get Game Over of Cait Sith's Slots limit break! There is no primed achievement notification for this either so you won't know you've done it right until the final hit.
- Jenova Synthesis: This should be the only use of Knights of the Round allowed toward this achievement. Using it at all on either form of Sephiroth following this fight will invalidate the achievement. Not much else to this fight.
- Bizzaro Sephiroth: You will be split into three teams. You'll have the opportunity here to set up each team's equipment and second check the materia. The party members with Cloud will move on to Safer Sephiroth so keep that in mind (make sure everyone can Long Range!). You will start with Cloud's party. Take out an arm part. Switch teams then take out another arm part. Switch yet again and take out yet another arm. Switch back to the Cloud and destroy the core and body. Honestly, the hardest part of this fight is targeting the part you want to destroy! The pattern to go with on the sides is to hit the upper and lower arm parts (D and E), then take out part C. Switch at this point to the other side and repeat this pattern. Switch again and you'll be back with Cloud. Take out the Core (part C), then take out the body (part A) to win this phase of the battle. Some have stated in this achievement's comments that they attacked the head and didn't face issue with this achievement but I didn't risk it.
- Safer Sephiroth: With all of the materia and levels, this should be a cakewalk. Use your items to heal and focus on the physical damage. Enjoy the Super Nova or two!

**Duel of the Blades**: (Progression) Press the win button against the real Sephiroth and witness the still impressively cinematic "final battle". Congrats on completing the normal run!

### David and Goliath

The primary guide that I used for this achievement is [GarlandG's GameFAQs guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/faqs/32536). Despite it being a Low Level AND No Materia run, the notes are still applicable and well detailed regarding how to route this. I'm not following it exactly, but it was a great starting point for figuring out how to do this since I hadn't attempted something like this before.

***TODO***: The GarlandG route and my notes can be removed from the final guide, since my route notes will cover the differences and why, for the most part.

| 25000 | Hojo                          | Yuffie    | Cloud, Cait   |

Since I want to get some enemy skills to make things easier later (Big Guard, White Wind, L4 Suicide, and Chocobuckle) as well as do some skips, I can update the above route to include these required fights while getting rid of other fights. Smoggers can be removed because we will have Poison materia before Bottomswell where it is first needed. Additionally, some fights will be skipped (Stingers in Gi Cave, Turks and Proud Clod fights in Midgar Raid). A Wutai visit might be necessary for obtaining the Swift Bolts and Fire Veils...

***TODO***: The link to the route will change to a final version that will be set up for sharing specifically so that others can edit their own copies.

The route spreadsheet is set up to calculate the XP values earned by the active character and inactive party members while telling you how much total XP they have, the level it equates to, and the buffer to reaching level 29 (the level cell turns yellow at level 28 and red at 29). This will allow others to make their own adjustments to the route based on how they want to tackle it and see how it impacts the buffer, while ALSO providing a way to do live route updating.

Guide format: Sections are broken up by location. Encounters are in bold and followed by potential tactics based on my route. Between battles will be discussion on important item pickups from the area.

General guidance:
- Run from all random encounters.
- SAVE SAVE SAVE and use multiple slots and memory card files!!!
- Get items from chests/bags/etc. in the area.
- ***TODO***: Who should get any Sources we find??? GarlandG says Cloud. Is that centered around the final battle?
- Money is tight until Steal materia is obtained.
- Healing items will also be tight and their use needs to be carefully thought out.
- A calculator and Sense materia are unnecessary! Pressing Select+R1 on the controller will bring up an HP indicator using the RetroAchievements user interface. Very handy!

#### Disc 1: Midgar

##### Reactor 1 Bombing Mission

**MP x2 fight**: Cloud is the only participant and earns 32 XP, reaching level 7. Enough said about that fight.

After the fight, the knocked out guards have potions that will be useful for healing. There is a Phoenix Down off the beaten path if you want, but it may not be necessary. Save before the boss fight. Consider setting up for the escape encounter plan as you did for **The Great Escape** achievement to reduce the number of fights you have to run from and potential damage sustained/death.

**Guard Scorpion (800 HP)**: As a reminder, you can press Select+R1 to bring up the boss' HP and it'll count down as you deal damage to it. Cloud uses Bolt and Barret attacks. My route is to have Barret survive so when Guard Scorpion raises it's tail attack it with Cloud while Barret defends so Cloud takes a bunch of damage. When HP get's low, let Cloud die or take him out yourself and then finish the job with Barret's low damage output. You shouldn't need to heal during the fight (and it'll consume potions) so if things go south, consider resetting and trying again.

Run from the encounters. When getting cornered by the guards, make sure to say "Later", otherwise you'll have to reset (the fights are unrunnable).

##### Sector 7/Reactor 5 Bombing Mission

Progress the story at Seventh Heaven, then head to the Beginner's Hall to get an All materia and Ether. Purchase some Potions at the item shop (GarlandG gets 8 of them) and Grenades at the weapon shop (GarlandG buys 6 intended for Smoggers but we can use them elsewhere). Save and head to the train.

When the alert goes off, get all the items just like during the normal run (talk to the man laying down in the back of the first car for a Phoenix Down, the man at the front of the second car for a Hi-Potion). Get to the reactor, picking up items as you go, and set the bomb. GarlandG fights three battles with 2 Smoggers each for their Deadly Waste, but we will have Poison materia available to us, so that is some XP saved.

Preparation for Air Buster: Similar to GarlandG's strategy. At the save crystal before the fight, save in a new slot and then get into a battle and kill off Tifa. Have Cloud and Barret fill their limit gauges. Once Barret's gauge is full, move him to the back row and defend. Get Cloud's HP down low (GarlandG recommends below 35) and then escape.

**Air Buster (1200 HP)**: Hold the Circle button and you should win with this setup. Barret and Cloud's limit breaks go off and Air Buster's counter attacks will kill off Cloud. Barret will just shoot until Air Buster dies. ***TODO***: Can we use a Grenade or two? Perhaps equip Lightning materia on Barret while in the back row for safety?
