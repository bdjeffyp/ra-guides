**TODO:** Update the link and achievement count

This is not an official manual, walkthrough, or critical review. This document is a simple guide for the current achievement set (130 as of 9/23/2023) available on [RetroAchievements](https://retroachievements.org/game/3528). This guide will give the player tips on earning the achievements, hash compatibility, and any other necessary or useful information.

Spoiler solutions for the boss strategies and a potential order to earning the achievements will be hidden in a collapsible entry that you must click to expand so that only the solutions you need assistance with will be viewable. Some of the more minor achievements will have strategies written outright without a collapsible dropdown so use the guide at your own risk.

## Introduction

**TODO:** Update the intro, also probably a good point to discuss the history of this set and highlight the **David and Goliath** achievement. Specify that I am using the PlayStation face button identifiers when discussing controller inputs.

Final Fantasy IV is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the Super Famicom. Released in Japan in 1991, it is the fourth installment in the Final Fantasy series. This game features a more story-driven approach (a la Final Fantasy II), centered around the dark knight Cecil. However, many of the mechanics introduced in Final Fantasy III make their return here: character job classes (though they are fixed for the most part), the Fat Chocobo, many vehicle options, graphic designs, and some dungeons that require specific mechanics to traverse. The similarities to Final Fantasy III are probably due to the game being initially designed for the Famicom/NES [(source)](https://web.archive.org/web/20161216181140/http://matotree.com/2012/08/final-fantasy-iv-for-the-famicom-was-80-complete/).

With the focus on plot, Final Fantasy IV will push you into situations that can lock you out of areas, characters, and abilities as you progress. As a result, many achievements for this game will become missable if you are not diligent. However, all achievements can be earned in one playthrough. This guide will attempt to help you in identifying the missable achievements if you'd rather not play this fantastic, but lengthy, game multiple times.

## Trivia

**TODO:** Update the trivia or remove the section

- This achievement set, created by [MrGauss](https://retroachievements.org/User/MrGauss), uses lines from Dante's Divine Comedy for the story achievements. The demons known as "Malebranches" in the Divine Comedy are the inspiration for the Four Arch-Fiends.
- Final Fantasy IV has had numerous ports and remakes. Notoriously, the US version released on the Super NES was censored and made easier for the American market. In Japan, Square re-released Final Fantasy IV on the Super Famicom, called "Final Fantasy IV Easy Type". Many refer to "Easy Type" as the US version, but it is actually another iteration that builds off the US Version. You can read more about the many versions for the SNES/Super Famicom [here](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy_IV_version_differences), as well as all of the numerous other ports and their differences.
- A sequel game was developed for Japanese mobile phones, subtitled "The After Years". This game was eventually ported and released worldwide on the WiiWare service of the Nintendo Wii system and also experienced it's own share of ports and remakes.
- A 3D remake was released on the Nintendo DS, similar in appearance to the Final Fantasy III remake and made by the same studio, Matrix Software.

## Save Support

**TODO:** Update the save support section. Perhaps similar to what was used for DQ8.

The game uses a battery to save game data across four slots. Players can save the game at any time while on the overworld map or in certain safe spots in dungeons to any one of the slots.

## Compatibility

**TODO:** Update this to be more in line with my other guides in how I discuss using the Supported Game Files page with a link to it

Currently (as of 9/23/2023) this game has 5 unique ROM(s) registered for it. View the linked hashes at the [Supported Game Files](https://retroachievements.org/linkedhashes.php?g=3528) page.

Please view the [Final Fantasy IV Official Thread](https://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=10172) for more details on setting up the ROM with the latest version of the Namingway Edition patch.

## Leaderboards

**TODO:** Update with the state of leaderboards for FFVII.

There are two leaderboards currently associated with the game.

- [Game Speed Run](https://retroachievements.org/leaderboardinfo.php?i=8113) - The fastest time needed to finish the game
- [Sum of party level](https://retroachievements.org/leaderboardinfo.php?i=8114) - The lowest level of all characters at game's end

## Achievement Categories

**TODO:** Update with my categorizations for this set that I will figure out after writing my notes. Also, this section should link to the breakdown sections below.

There are a currently a total of 130 achievements, which can be broken down into the following categories:

- **Story/Progression**: 14 achievements earned naturally through the course of gameplay
- **Summons**: 4 achievements related to summons for Rydia earned by going to out-of-the-way locations (**1 is missable**)
- **Boss Challenge**: 18 achievements (**17 are missable**) that require special action during boss fights by the player to successfully earn the achievement
- **Commands**: 24 achievements (**15 are missable**) that require use of the special commands of characters in certain situations or completion of a specific objective in one gameplay session
- **Treasure**: 33 achievements (**4 are missable**) which require finding all treasure, including hidden items, in a specified location
- **Dancer**: 8 achievements which require talking to specific NPCs
- **Chicobo Quest**: 15 achievements which require you to find a specific, out-of-the-way, location hinted in the achievement description and pressing the [Y] button.
- **Endgame Items**: 3 achievements (**1 is marked as missable for it's difficulty**) for items which are earned by events and grinding
- **Miscellaneous**: 11 achievements (**1 is missable**) that don't fit in the above categories, including 2 related to a specific endgame item to help avoid missing it
- Out of all of the achievements, **39 are missable**

## Potential Order

**TODO:** There will definitely be a roadmap for this set. Two playthroughs minimum.

The following is a breakdown of the order of achievements based on my personal playthrough. Note that your mileage may vary due to the path you may desire to take, such as getting Odin before going to the Moon.

Each section is grouped under story achievements and hidden under a dropdown to avoid spoilers. If you want to see the achievements, **click on the arrow** next to each section to reveal the table. The dropdown names have the number of achievements in the section so that you can see at a glance about how many achievements you should have by the end of a section, if you were to follow my guide to the letter. I have call outs to sections where a grind may be appropriate for the three grind achievements. If you want to see the entire thing without having to click the arrows, [checkout the fully expanded roadmap!](Final-Fantasy-IV-Roadmap)

:no_entry: **MINOR SPOILER SECTION** :no_entry:
<br>The tables only reveal when achievements can be earned and possibly missed. No strategies on earning the achievements are provided here, just the order I earned them in.

**Grind alert!** Goblins in the overworld very rarely drop their eponymous summon. The only other Goblin type that drops the summon is in the Lunar Subterrane with the same drop rate.

**Grind alert!** Mindflayers in the Magnetic Cave can very rarely drop their eponymous summon. This is the only location they appear in this game, which is pretty inconvenient. It may be best to grind for the summon AFTER defeating the Dark Elf since the cave's magnetic properties will subside.

**Grind alert!** Balloons in the Tower of Babil can very rarely drop their eponymous summon. You can also get it from them and the Grenades on the Moon later, if you'd rather wait, since the drop rate is low.

**NOTE:** Elemental Cure is broken. It triggers when a FellKnight uses Absorb in the Defender Sword Monster-in-a-Box fight. It should be available to earn when a character has a Cursed Ring with an elemental reducing armor equipped. It isn't too big of a deal that this one achievement out of 130 pops early, given that you still need to grind for a Cursed Ring anyway... ðŸ˜‰

**Grind alert!** If you don't have the remaining summon items, now is the time to get them. You will also be grinding for Pink Tail(s) in the Lunar Subterrane, and the Cursed Ring from the Souls and Spirits at Mt. Ordeals if you didn't get that earlier.

The final boss must be fought more than once to complete the set. I would think it may be best to beat the game with the full party first, reload the save, then grind to get Cecil ready for the final fight...

Special call out: The incredibly grind heavy Evil Jewelry, Summoning Mastery, and One of a Kind. They are not included in the order list above because of the rare drops involved in their achievements: 1/64 chance for the applicable item IF an item drops from the monster. See the Grind section below for strategies on how to complete the grind.

## Category Breakdowns

**TODO:** Obviously, this will get an overhaul on my strategies when I take my notes and put them here...

### Story/Progression

No discussion on the progression achievements here as you simply need to play through the game to earn them. You can't miss them!

### Summons

The three non-missable summons achievements are standard boss fights with no special requirements for boss challenge achievements. Therefore, have fun with these fights and experiment on your own or refer to your favorite strategy guide/GameFAQ for details.

The only missable achievement in this section is [Loyal Friend](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108637). **It is only available between when Kain leaves the group before going to the Moon!** When the opportunity presents itself to go to the Moon, it would be wise to fully explore the world to wrap up any loose ends before departing.

<details>
<summary>Expand for spoiler</summary>

- Find Yang in the Sylphs' Cave
- Go to Fabul to see Sheila and get the Frying Pan
- Go back to Sylphs' Cave and use the Frying Pan on Yang.

This series of steps is also closely related to the [Bull's Eye](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108675) achievement and why that is also marked as missable.

</details>

### Boss Challenge

:no_entry: **HERE, THERE BE SPOILERS!** :no_entry:

This is where the meat of the achievement set is at! If you wish to challenge yourself, I recommend not expanding the strategies I used to complete these fun and puzzling achievements. Make use of nearby save spots where possible and experiment with the skills and items you have to complete these very awesome challenges!

| Badge | Title | Strategy |

| [![Mist dragon](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/109793.png "The Steel and the Mist")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108640) | [The Steel and the Mist](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108640) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Don't attack while she is in Mist form, only while in Dragon form. Take a couple of rounds of attacks for both Kain and Cecil and then wait for it to change forms. Repeat until dead. Use mist form rounds for healing if necessary. </details> |
| [![Soldier with a sword](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/109814.png "No Messengers Left")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108641) | [No Messengers Left](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108641) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Take out two guards, then concentrate on the General. Killing all three guards first will result in the General fleeing the battle. </details> |

I recommend lowering the battle speed to 6 in order to give your characters more chances to attack. If you are still having trouble defeating Octomamm with a large enough hit to kill him before he goes to one leg remaining, you may need to grind a bit for levels to raise your base strength. </details> |
| [![An insectoid monster with bug eyes and gaping toothy mouth](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/110965.png "Reactionless Jaws")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108643) | [Reactionless Jaws](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108643)      | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>_Unfortunately, I didn't keep notes on this fight and don't have a save nearby to verify my memory here..._ Don't physically attack! Using Cecil's Dark is key, since that is not a physical attack and doesn't consume MP. Keep Cecil's health up with potions from Edward and Rydia. Another possibility is to have Edward Sing and hope that it causes the Charm status effect so that the Antlion attacks itself. </details> |
| [![Large red bomb-type monster](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/111289.png "Explosive Sync")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108644) | [Explosive Sync](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108644) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>When Mom Bomb grows full size, cease attacks. A party member will say, "It's gonna blow!". As it explodes and begins to split into the six bombs, use a Silk Web item to slow the bombs immediately. Have Yang use Kick to knock down the health of all the bombs slightly. Now cycle to Edward and have him attack each blue bomb individually to get their health in range, hopefully without critical hits. Once all three blue bombs were attacked without dying, a single Dark command from Cecil should take them all out in one shot and the achievement will be awarded. </details> |
| [![Horned zombie demon](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/113138.png "Malebranche of Earth")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108645) | [Malebranche of Earth](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108645) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Use Palom's Boost command until maxed out (6 times?). Then have Palom cast Fira on Scarmiglione. This will meet the requirement of taking out the boss with only one action **on him!** My Palom was Level 19 when I got this achievement. </details> |
| [![Serpent faced humanoid with snakes for hands](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/113431.png "Minimalist Struggle")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108646) | [Minimalist Struggle](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108646) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Note that party members can die but must be alive before the battle ends! Make sure to save in the Ancient Waterway. Have Tellah cast Mini on your party prior to entering the central hall of Baron Castle. Since you are Mini, Palom cannot use his Boast command to strengthen his spells. Palom should use his strongest spells: Quake, or Bio if Quake isn't available yet. I recommend getting Quake unlocked in the Ancient Waterway if you don't have it though. Buff your party with Tellah and Porom casting Blink to avoid taking too much damage. Since Baigan's body counters spells with Reflect, use low level spells on his body to wear off the effect. I used Cure twice on him to bounce a healing spell back at my party while wearing off his Reflect. It can take two hits before the Reflect wears off. Once it does, use Quake again to win. </details> |
| [![Turtle demon surrounded by raging waters](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/113433.png "Malebranche of Water")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108647) | [Malebranche of Water](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108647) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>No one can die this time around. Since you just fought Baigan, it would be wise to return to the Ancient Waterway to save your game again. You can use a Tent here or use Cecil's bed to heal up as well. If you have your battle speed at or near "1", you may want to lower it. I found that Cagnazzo is too quick and fires off Haste before Tellah is even able to cast a spell when the battle speed was at "1". Once I lowered the speed down to "6", this challenge was in the bag. Have Palom cast Bio and Tellah cast Thundaga, skipping everyone else. Those two spells should put Cagnazzo inside his shell before he casts Haste if it doesn't kill him outright. Cast one more Bio or Thundara/Thundaga to finish up the fight. </details> |
| [![Squat, yet long limbed, creature with long hair and a horn](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/117082.png "Winds of Victory")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108648) | [Winds of Victory](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108648) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Only the Dark Dragon phase of this fight matters for the achievement. Dark Dragon is susceptible to Tornado (hence the name of the achievement). Care must be taken to not have actions queued when the Dark Elf changes into the Dark Dragon as any extra actions taken will invalidate the achievement. In my many attempts, I found that my party took 10 attack actions on the Dark Elf before it changed. Your party levels may be different though so use caution around 7-8 attacks on the Elf. Once it does change, use Tornado and then follow with an attack from any other character. Do note though that Tornado still has a chance to fail. If it does fail, it still counts as an action on the boss and thus a reset is required. It can be annoying to reset and then deal with the story stuff and equipment changes but fast-forward is your friend... </details> |
| [![Three women: one tall with a spear and one short with a knife](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/117122.png "Magical Miscalculation")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108649) | [Magical Miscalculation](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108649) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Some have talked about Tellah having Dispel and using that to cancel out the Reflect status on Cindy; however, my Tellah did not have Dispel. I also saw people talk about casting Silence on Sandy so that she can't cast Reflect. I was never able to get Silence to stick though. So, I attacked Cindy until her health was low, doing approximately 4000 HP of damage. Note that Cid's Study and Libra spells don't work, so you'll have to keep track of the damage dealt in your head. When you think you are close, kill Sandy. While Cid, Yang, and Cecil attack Sandy, have Tellah cast Cura on Cindy to try to wear down her Reflect status. I found that when Sandy puts Reflect on Cindy, the status will stay on just until I have killed Sandy, which will then expose Cindy to Mindy's spells. If you time it right and have Cindy's health low enough, Mindy will end up killing Cindy and the achievement will pop. There may be better ways to do this, but this is the process that worked for me. Make sure you save right after this fight since another boss challenge follows shortly after this! </details> |
| [![Woman with long hair wrapped around her like a whirlwind](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/117137.png "Malebranche of Wind")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108650) | [Malebranche of Wind](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108650) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Yang's Focus will be the primary damage dealer since you can't use Kain's Jump to break up Barbariccia's whirlwind form. Focus will ignore the defense of the whirlwind. So, focus your efforts on keeping everyone alive and not fully petrifying. Cecil and Rosa can provide healing and Esuna. Cid and Kain can use Gold Needles and healing potions. There is some luck involved in this with Barbariccia's Tornados landing their hit or not. If the Tornado does connect, heal that character immediately (Yang should still Focus though). If Barbariccia does her follow up physical attack on the tornado'd character, they'll die. You may benefit from lowering your battle speed on this fight. Barbariccia's Ray does gradual petrification. So you have a few rounds before you need to cure the effect. You'll know it is close when the character looks like they are fully stone but still standing and able to act. If Gold Needles are running low, take a chance and only recover the debuff when they look like they are fully grey. Do note that Ray cast on the same character multiple times speeds this up. If a character gets hit by Ray twice in a row, focus on curing the affected person. </details> |
| [![Large and creepy doll with crown and hair in pigtails](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/117225.png "Danse Macabre")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108651) | [Danse Macabre](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108651) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>For every Calca doll taken down, a Brina doll must also fall. Attack on Brina doll, then kill one Calca. Continue attacking the dolls in pairs like that. When there is only one pair remaining, the Brina doll is weaker so that should be the last doll standing. Concentrate attacks on the last Calca doll and all attacks will then shift to the final Brina, which should fall quickly before it can change to Calcabrina. </details> |
| [![A small person pilots a giant humanoid robot](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/117412.png "Clockwork Destruction")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108652) | [Clockwork Destruction](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108652) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>The first phase of the fight, when Dr. Lugae and Barnab are separate, use Haste spells and Hermes items to speed up the entire party. Attack Barnab until it falls. Bring up Yang's menu. As soon as Dr. Lugae talks about taking manual control, select the Focus command. Have the next character use a Silk Web item or cast Slow on Barnab-Z. Now have everyone attack. I managed to get lucky on my attempt and Rosa did a critical hit with Aim, followed by Yang's standard attack killing Barnab-Z. I think even without the crit, I was on track to beating out Barnab-Z's explosion with everyone attacking, Rosa Aiming, and Rydia casting Thundara. </details> |
| [![Red faced demon draped in red and blue cape with hand extended](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/117556.png "Malebranche of Fire")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108653) | [Malebranche of Fire](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108653) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Perhaps the toughest challenge?? Rosa needs to know Reflect, which she learns at level 36. This fight is a matter of timing. Since you cannot target Rubicante directly, you will need to set Reflect on a party member and then have Rydia bounce Blizzara off that character. This will take about 11 hits to accomplish (my Rydia at level 36 required that many hits). Rubicante's pattern: opens his cloak and uses his Scorch technique, closes his cloak, physically attacks one or two characters, and repeats. Rosa should cast Reflect on a surviving party member after Rubicante's physical attacks, which should be cast before he opens his cloak. Ensure Rydia is ready to cast as soon as Rubicante opens his cloak, then select the Blizzara spell and target your party member that has the Reflect status. This should hit Rubicante before he uses Scorch. If Rubicante Scorches, he will close his cloak immediately after, so it is very important to cast Blizzara as he opens his cloak or you will miss. Contingencies will be needed as party members are attacked and die. Edge, Cecil, and Kain should be using Phoenix Downs to revive characters. If Rosa or Rydia are taken out, you may miss a cycle. Take time to breathe and think through every action. I found this challenge to be very intense because of the concentration needed and finding the rhythm. It was very satisfying to accomplish! In my first attempt at this, I didn't have nearly enough Phoenix Downs and needed to leave the Tower of Babil to stock back up. In my second attempt, I was trying to keep people healed with Cecil's Cura or Hi-Potions, but found that would cause problems with the cycle so I only focused on raising dead party members. Keeping people alive increases targets for Rubicante's attacks and thus less chance of targeting Rydia or Rosa. Of course, balance is key. If you can't get back into a cycle because he keeps taking out your party, take some rounds to restore with stronger spells or items and then get back into the rhythm again. Good luck!! </details> |
| [![The facade of a toothy grinning demon emerging from a wall](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/117870.png "Under Pressure")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108654) | [Under Pressure](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108654) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>After the final save point in the Sealed Cave, there is one more TrapDoor to face before entering the Crystal Chamber. You may want to defeat the door before setting yourself up for this fight and possibly go back up to the save point, just in case. Set battle mode to Active and lower battle speed AND battle message to 6. Active is required for the achievement and a speed of 6 will give you more time to react. If you cleared out the Sylph Cave prior to going to the Sealed Cave, the Avenger Sword can be beneficial. Use a Silk Web or cast Slow to slow down the Demon Wall, use Bacchus Wines or cast Berserk on your front line, and have Rydia summon Leviathan. The Silk Web will cause Demon Wall to retaliate with a gradual petrification spell, but you can ignore it since you will beat the boss before that takes full effect. Characters won't be able to do anything until the wall has already moved two times and probably won't make their first actions after the third movement. I tried this a few times, changing the battle speed to see when I can get my party to act sooner, but a speed of 6 for both battle speed and message was key. Additionally, I got good damage rolls from Rydia's Leviathan and a crit from Edge, so luck may play a part in this. I also moved items and spells around in order to put them where the cursor appears in the menu to speed up my actions. Another possibility could be to Haste party members, especially the one with the Avenger Sword or Rydia (but I haven't tried this...). </details> |
| [![The faces of the four malebranches](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/118439.png "Fiendish Rematch")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108655) | [Fiendish Rematch](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108655) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>If you did some grinding for Alerts/Sirens and repeatedly fought monsters summoned by the Searchers, you will have no issues with the Arch Fiends this time around. Fusoya's Bless keeps health bumped up with Rosa supplementing healing. Rosa should focus on anyone who get's dangerously close to low health (especially Edge). Use Rydia's opposing third level elemental spell or Bahamut if you have him at this point, Haste Cecil and have him attack, use Edge's opposing elemental Ninjutsu as appropriate also. </details> |
| [![Three floating metallic spheres](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/118446.png "Fatal Error")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108656) | [Fatal Error](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108656) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>The order to take down the nodes is Defense, CPU, Attack. If the Defense and Attack nodes are killed before the CPU, you will lose this challenge. So, the biggest concern is accidentally killing the Attack node before the CPU is defeated. Since the CPU casts Reflect on itself, you have no choice but to physically attack it. Have Fusoya keep your health up with Bless to negate the Attack node's paltry attack beams and keep on attacking the CPU. Once that is down, kill the Attack node and the achievement will pop! </details> |
| [![A shadowy ghost howling](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/118874.png "Cosmic Duel")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108657) | [Cosmic Duel](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108657) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>This should be easy enough if you have been grinding for the Adamant Armor. Have a healthy stack of Elixirs available as well, which you should have enough money to buy a bunch from the Flan Princess fights. When the battle with Zeromus begins and everyone is revived by your friends, kill them off again before using the Crystal. With the final battle now beginning, switch between attacks and using Elixirs. You may have some opportunities to get two attacks in, depending on if Zeromus used Flare, Meteor, or Holy on you successfully. You should have too much difficulty with this at this point though, if you have been working on getting everything you need for all of the achievements in one playthrough. Do note though that you will have to fight Zeromus twice in order to get this achievement as well as Shadow Hands. I opted for Shadow Hands first and then followed up with Cosmic Duel.<br/><br/>A brilliant suggestion by [Kencussion](https://retroachievements.org/user/Kencussion) regarding getting both Shadow Hands AND Cosmic Duel in one battle:<br/>"Keep your whole party alive when you start battle with Zeromus, but do NOT use the Crystal right away. The achievement for beating Zeromus with only Cecil begins once the Crystal is used... so before you use the Crystal, have Edge steal the Dark Matter from Zeromus' first form to get the 'Shadow Hands' achievement. Then kill off everyone in your party except Cecil (you may want Rosa to buff Cecil first), and then have him use the Crystal on Zeromus. When Zeromus reveals his second form, only Cecil will be alive and you can get the 'Cosmic Duel' achievement!"</details> |

### Commands

The intent of these achievements is to showcase the utility of the character's various special abilities, as they were not present in the original US release. They provide a great preview of how they work and their necessity in completing some of the boss challenge achievements. It is recommended trying to get these achievements as soon as the necessary character joins your party, because a lot of them are missable.

| Badge | Title | Tips |
|:---:|---|---|
| [![Dark knight with sword raised to strike](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/109686.png "Ultimate Darkness")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108658) | [Ultimate Darkness](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108658) | The best place for this is in the area around the Antlion's Den and Mt. Hobs. There is an encounter with eight Goblins, which is perfect fodder for taking down with one Dark command. |
| [![Dragoon knight jumping onto an enemy](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/109786.png "Deadly Acrobatics")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108659) | [Deadly Acrobatics](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108659) | You will find flying enemies right out the gate in the fields surrounding Baron. A perfect time to get this when also doing an early attempt at getting the Goblin summon. |
| [![Old man Tellah thinking with speech bubble](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/109916.png "No Enough Omega-3")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108660) | [Not Enough Omega-3](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108660) | Just start using the Recall command as much as you can when you first get Tellah. Watch your MP though and rest to recover it as needed. |
| [![Singing bard](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/109921.png "Siren's Pupil")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108661) | [Siren's Pupil](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108661) | Simply use Edward's Sing command as much as you can as soon as he joins and you'll unlock this in no time. |
| [![Purple frog wearing bard's red hat](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/110002.png "Song of the Frogs")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108662) | [Song of the Frogs](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108662) | Once Rydia learns Toad, cast the spell on Edward and Sing to attempt to turn a monster into a Toad. Note that the song must successfully transform the monster. I found it best to attempt this on Goblins around Mt. Hobs/Antlion's Den. |
| [![Bard character surrounded by magic effects](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/110000.png "Salve of Salvation")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108663) |  [Salve of Salvation](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108663) | There is some controversy surrounding this achievement. It seems to require the Namingway Edition patch of the game to work properly, despite the set being linked to a base FF4(J) ROM. This is because the intent of the achievement is to use Salve when you have a party of five to heal for a total of 375 HP or greater. Since the Namingway Edition patch buffs the Salve command, it seems to only be possible with that patch to unlock this achievement. That is why the patch is the only recommended way to play through this achievement set. |
| [![Bard cowering in fear](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/110001.png "Spoony Bard")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108664) | [Spoony Bard](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108664) | Just manually hide Edward with the Hide command and then win a battle. I'm not sure if it pops the achievement with Edward hiding automatically when his health is low though. I didn't wait to see if that was the case... |
| [![White wizard with one eye closed and drawing back a bow with an arrow](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/111279.png "Supreme Aim")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108665) | [Supreme Aim](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108665) | Rosa doesn't have the Mini spell right away. I tried to get this achievement with the Tiny Mages but they are not in Mini status so they don't count. You will need to first use Mini on monsters successfully, then use Aim to kill them. Again, Goblins are a perfect candidate for this. There is no pressure for this achievement because it is not missable. |
| [![White wizard praying](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/111281.png "Hoping for a Miracle")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108666) | [Hoping for a Miracle](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108666) | Another command achievement that is not missable, but it is best to try to get this in a controlled situation. Since Pray is not 100% successful, it could be better to wait to get this when party members enter critical state with a lot of HP left over. You could also just try to Pray often as soon as you get Rosa when two characters are near death. It's up to you. |
| [![Monk meditates with eyes closed](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/111300.png "Fist of the Dragon")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108667) | [Fist of the Dragon](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108667) | I wasn't able to get this until I got the Cat Claw in the Tower of Babil and Focused on an enemy weak to Ice with Yang equipped with the Ice and Cat Claws. It was pretty much the final floor before losing Yang for the rest of the game. |
| [![Monk in a defensive stance](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/111301.png "Stance of the Tiger")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108668) | [Stance of the Tiger](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108668) | Note that the achievement description mentions "magical effect". Brace has a chance of casting Protect on Yang on top of his defensive stance. Simply use Brace a lot while everyone else parries until you Yang Braces with Protect four times in one battle. |

### Treasure

There are **four** locations that are missable: Tower of Zot, Tower of Babil first visit, Tower of Babil second visit, and Giant of Babil.

I am not going into details on treasure locations since there are a ton of pre-existing resources out there that map the locations of every treasure and hidden item in the game. I made use of mostly excellent maps at [GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/snes/588330-final-fantasy-iv/faqs) to get all of these achievements.

Some minor notes:
<br>From the beginning of the game, you can start on the Chocobo Forest Treasure Hunter achievement. Don't forget to grab the Gysahl Green in the grass of every Chocobo Forest.
<br>The Chocobo Village has two Gysahl Greens hidden in grass on the far right. There is a path through the trees by the "back of the head" of the Chocobo.
<br>A chest with 1000 gil in Kokkol's Forge is hidden to the right of the stairs going to the second floor.

### Dancer

Talk to every NPC in towns to ensure you get these. Since none are missable, I won't go into detail here on where to find them. The dancer in Fabul Castle is VERY close to the King's bedroom though, so that is the perfect opportunity to get the [Regal Rest](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108729) achievement as well!

### Chicobo Quest

The achievement set creator, [MrGauss](https://retroachievements.org/User/MrGauss), made great descriptions that help to hint at the correct location. However, they also provided close up images of the badges for the Chicobo Quest achievements if the image in the locked achievement is too blurry. These can help in finding the correct location to stand and press the "Y" button on your controller.

### Endgame Items, a.k.a. The Grind

**Setup:** When I do grinding for achievements, I make good use of the tools at my disposal to make the grind a bit easier and more comfortable. Since this is a Super NES game, I make use of the triggers (or L2/R2) to do fast-forward toggling. If I want to speed up the action, I hold down the trigger to activate fast-forward. For extended grinding sessions, rather than hold the trigger, I keep fast-forward active (using the '-' key on the keyboard) and then my trigger is used to temporarily turn off fast-forward until I let go.
<br>In the late game, grinds can be done easily by quickly moving left and right (or up and down) in the area where the desired encounters are and hold down the "B" button to run. When the battle starts, I let go of "B" and hold down the "A" button so that everyone attacks. When the battle ends, I make sure to continue to hold down "A" through the item menu if it appears. If you switch back to the "B" button, you could lose the item!
<br>In all item grinds, quantity of the desired enemy matters. Every enemy instance has a chance to drop an item and then if they drop they have a 1/64 chance of dropping the required item for the grind. For example, three Spirits and a Soul in one battle will provide a greater chance at dropping a Cursed Ring rather than one Dinozombie.

[![Ring topped with jeweled skull emitting evil aura](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/118270.png "Evil Jewelry")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108718) [Evil Jewelry](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108718): A great time to initially grind for this item would be right after Cecil becomes a paladin. To support this, purchase the armor for a paladin (Light Shield, Light Helm, Knight Armor, and Gauntlet) from Mysidia before going to Mt. Ordeals. Since Cecil is level 1 when he becomes a paladin, you can now grind for levels for him as well as attempting to get the Cursed Ring from the Souls and Spirits on Mt. Ordeals. Once Cecil class changes, go down to the base of the mountain and look for Souls and Spirits to grind on. There is a group of three Spirits and one Soul that is perfect. Make use of **Twincast** with the Twins to speed up the battles! If you need to heal, you can run out of Mt. Ordeals to the Chocobo Forest to the south and restore your MP at the White Chocobo. If you don't find a Cursed Ring by the time Cecil reaches level 20, then it may be better to wait until later to get it. I personally didn't get the Cursed Ring until the end game, having to grind at Mt. Ordeals while watching Twitch so that I wouldn't get board and leaving the game on fast-forward the entire time. Do note that the achievement pops as soon as you win the battle, since the item drops are determined at that time.

[![An open book with a bubble containing fire floating over it](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/118132.png "Summoning Mastery")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108681) [Summoning Mastery](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108681): There are four monster summons you can get as very rare item drops: Goblin, Bomb, Mindflayer, and Cockatrice. See the below chart for enemies and locations to grind for the drop:

| Spell | Monster | Location |
|:---:|---|---|
| Goblin | Goblin, Li'l Killer/Murderer | Outside Baron, around Mt.Hobs/Antlion Den |
| Bomb | Grenade, Balloon | Lunar Surface |
| Mindflayer | Mindflayer | Magnetic Cavern |
| Cockatrice | Cockatrice | Around and outside of Mt. Hobs |

[![A glittering armored breastplate](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/118808.png "One of a Kind")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108720) [One of a Kind](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108720): This is the grind that most people think of when it comes to Final Fantasy IV. Getting the Pink Tail actually isn't as bad as it could be, if you are prepared. This achievement set actually provides a couple of achievements to aid you in this grind: [Alert!](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108732) and [Avatar of Patience](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108733).
<br>The Alert! achievement is designed to let you know the ideal area to grind for the Siren item: the Giant of Babil's head. While this is a great location to grind for experience, you don't actually need to grind for the Siren items from the Searcher enemy. That's because Sirens are for sale in the Hummingway Haven on the Moon if you are playing the Namingway Edition patch, like you should be. If you do want to get Sirens from the Searchers, kill off your party except for Edge and steal the item from the Searchers over and over again.
<br> The Avatar of Patience achievement tells you the room to use the Sirens in when you explore the Lunar Subterrane. Using a Siren in this room will make a group of five dancing Pink Flans appear. This fight can be difficult if your party is weak and Cecil doesn't have his Crystal gear or the Ribbons for Rydia and Rosa. Pink Flans can be killed easily with a couple Bahamut summons or just attacks if your party is at a high enough level. Just take care to heal. A lot of progress can be lost with a party wipe.
<br>Once you **finally** have a Pink Tail, return to Earth and give the item to the tail collector in the Adamant Grotto.

## Notes

The guide I am using primarily for navigating the game is https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/faqs/71240.

### Disc 1

**On Guard**: (Boss) The first achievement and also first missable. The game instructs you on how to deal with Guard Scorpion's counterattack too. Just don't attack while the tail is up. The boss will take four rounds (two Search Scopes and two attacks) before raising it's tail so do as much damage as you can before that happens. When you get near the point where it could attack, stop issuing commands (unless using items) and wait out the tail. Once the camera begins to shift back to the side view, you can start issuing attack commands again. If you are using Cloud's Bolt and limit breaks as they happen, you should be able to beat the boss before it can raise it's tail again. Also, putting Barret in the back row is always a good idea since he is a ranged attacker, so you might as well do that here, especially if you are prepping for **The Great Escape**.

**The Great Escape**: (Challenge? Minigame?) Getting out of the reactor before 7:45 on the timer is not too hard if you prepare a little before the Guard Scorpion fight. In the Config menu, place ATB on Active, and Battle Speed and Battle Message to the far left for the fastest speed. ATB may not matter too much since we are just going to be running from battles, but I had it on Active anyway just in case. Active wasn't impactful to the Guard Scorpion fight either. Next, go to the screen where you fight Guard Scorpion, pick up the Restore materia, then go back a screen and save your game. Reset the console and reload. On the save crystal screen, walk around near the screen transition until you have two encounters. The first encounter will take a little bit to appear (it should be two Grunts and a Sweeper, in my experience). The second encounter will occur relatively quickly afterword (it should be a Sweeper, in my experience). Now, go fight Guard Scorpion. After the battle, begin to run back through the reactor the way you came in. Save Jessie on the way to the elevator. If you were efficient in your movements, you should have your first of two encounters as you approach Jessie. When the battle transitions occur, hold onto the L1+R1 (top bumper buttons) to escape the battle. In my experience, this was a fight with two Grunts and two Mono Drives so it can seem like you might be in the fight for a little while but you'll still have plenty of time. My time at escaping this battle was 9:20. In the room before the elevator, it's pretty easy to get caught on the railing for the stairs, but it shouldn't affect you getting out in time. In the elevator, press the button, close the dialog, and hold Left on the D-pad. Once the elevator stops, you'll run right out of the door easily. Talk to Jessie, then to Biggs. As you run toward the exit, your second encounter will happen (three Grunts). Then you are out of the door and the achievement will pop! My time was 8:02 with this strategy.

**A Thorough First Mission:** (Treasure) There are five items to get for this achievement. Four are located in Reactor 1 and one is in the surrounding street area after the bombing mission. The first two are potions on the two red uniformed guards knocked out by Biggs and Jessie at the very beginning of the game. The third is a Phoenix Down in a treasure chest in a room south of the elevator after Biggs and Jessie open the two doors. The last item in the reactor is the Potion on the floor where Jessie stands watch/gets stuck while you fight Guard Scorpion. The last item is on the ground near the fountain on the screen south of Aerith selling flowers.

**Seeing the Sights:** (Event) Missable because after you leave Sector 7, this NPC will have moved and events will prevent this conversation from happening. To get the event, after arriving at the Sector 7 Slums train station, there is a Save Crystal in the next screen. Just above that is an NPC who appears to be urinating near the fence leading to the plate support pillar. Talk to/interrupt them and they will foreshadow the future while you look at the pillar and get the achievement.

**The Wonders of the Base:** (Treasure) You'll need to get the first two items for this achievement before leaving Sector 7 Slums for the bombing of Reactor 5. Both are located in the Beginner's Hall above the weapon shop. Pick up the All materia on the ground near the entrance and then open the treasure chest that appears afterword to get an Ether.

**Keeping Track:** (Treasure) There are three items in total. When the lockdown event starts, go the rear of the initial car and talk to the person laying down on the seats to get a Phoenix Down. Return to the front of the screen to get to the next car. Head toward the screen and speak to the person near the exit and respond with "Yeah..." (the first option) to get a Hi-Potion. Move onto the third car and run into a pickpocket. Run after the pickpocket and talk to them. Respond with "That's right" (the second option) to get your money back. Head to the fourth car. There are no items here. Proceed as normal to jump off the train. The achievement should then pop after the conversation with Tifa and Barret in the tunnel.

**Above and Below the Plate:** (Treasure) There are eight items to get across the Sector 4 Plate area, Reactor 5, and Sector 5 Slums. Before entering Reactor 5, ensure you have three items measured. The first item is found in the duct after leaving the train, an Ether. The next item, a Potion, is in the room with Jessie, partially hidden by a wall. Finally, the third item is a tent located conveniently by the save crystal before entering the reactor area. In the reactor area, there is only one item, which is an Ether in a treasure chest found after leaving the elevator to the control room. You should have four items measured at this point before fighting Air Buster.

**Busted Up:** (Challenge) The best way to prepare for this is to get into an encounter in the location just before the boss, where you found the Ether in the chest and pressed the buttons at the same time to open the door to the save crystal. During the preparation battle, simply let your party get attacked until all three have hit their limit breaks. Use the Cure spell or items to heal if needed. In my experience, I had an encounter with two Special Combatants and a Proto Machinegun to get my limit breaks. Save the game and then proceed to the boss. Without any grinding, my party was all level 8, except Tifa at level 6. All three characters used their limit breaks right away and we took down Air Buster before it could take a turn. Air Buster may counter attack (it did, in my experience, against Barret's Big Shot), but that doesn't count against you as the boss having taken a turn.

**A Flower Blooming in the Slums:** (Challenge? Minigame? Puzzle?) Unfortunately, the only save point before this is prior to Air Buster, so if a mistake is made, you'll have a bit of a run back to make. The easiest way to handle this is to simply tell Aerith to "Hold on a minute" (first option) and push barrels in the following order: left, rear, and right. When Aerith makes it to the top of the stairs, the achievement will unlock.

**Above and Below the Plate (cont'd):** (Treasure) Once you enter the Sector 5 Slums, you can continue to work on this achievement. This is the point to note that there is one required item to get that impacts **Good Things Happen For Those Who Wait** by taking the kid's life savings (which will unlock **Killing Hope** as well). You can either set up a save at Aerith's house prior to getting the kid's life savings, get the remaining treasure and this achievement, then go back to the save and leave the life savings alone (you'll have to actually talk to the kid, check the hidden drawer, see the money, and then choose NOT to take it) so that you can get the other achievement later. Now for the remaining four items... Items five and six are located outside of Aerith's house (Cover materia and Ether). Item seven is in the bag in room you rest in inside Aerith's house. Item eight is the kid's money.

**Killing Hope/Good Things Happen For Those Who Wait:** (Mutually Exclusive) Missable achievements that are dependent on checking for the kid's life savings in the Sector 5 Slums and deciding to take or leave them. Take them to get **Killing Hope** or leave them and get the other achievement much later in the game. This is an easy one to get both in one run by using a save (as discussed in **Above and Below the Plate**) but one can also be deferred for the **David and Goliath** run. I went for both now, since **Killing Hope** is easy to get and reset to prep for the other.

**Moulin a Cafe:** Here is your first chance to read the first Turtle Paradise notice in the Turbo Ether kid's room (on the wall by the stairs).

**The Ballad of Heisenberg:** (Meme) You can purchase a grenade as early as Sector 5 Slums at the weapon shop near Aerith's House.

**A &$#% Up Moment/Group Bath and Taking Out the Small Fry/Dude (Looks Like a Lady):** (Mutually Exclusive) These sets of achievements are mutually exclusive that are dependent on performance in minigames and a choice of which room you enter in the Honeybee Inn. My intended path here is to go for the worst items (Lingerie/Phoenix Down) and associated achievements first, then reload the save and get the best items/achievements (Bikini Briefs/Hyper). I'll get **Workout Plan** in the second pass as well. Another option is to get the other mutually exclusive achievements while working toward **David and Goliath** (which I may recommend in the final guide writeup). To take the worse path, you simply need a wig and dress. Doing the minimum should ensure getting the worse path and making it quick to reset and take the better path. Additionally, you can get the Honeybee Inn mutually exclusive achievements right away, then work on the Don Corneo mutually exclusive achievements. Here is the order I did things in that seemed the most efficient: **A &$#% Up Moment**, reset then **Taking Out the Small Fry**, reset then **Group Bath** and **Dude (Looks Like a Lady)**. To ensure **Taking Out the Small Fry**, choose the first option twice when talking to the Dress Shop owner in the bar and he'll give you the Cotton Dress, ensuring Tifa is chosen by Don Corneo no matter how you do at the squats minigame. **Taking Out the Small Fry** unlocks after defeating Scotch and Lackeys (the second fight). The Honeybee Inn achievements are named after the rooms that you can enter. You'll want to go to the Group Room for getting Don Corneo to take Cloud. To get the best dress, choose the second option twice when talking to the Dress Shop owner. Out-squat in the gym to get the Blonde Wig. Get the Diamond Tiara from the materia shop owner by listening to their request, staying at the inn, getting the 200 gil item, and going back to the materia shop. Get the Sexy Cologne by getting the pharmacy coupon from the diner (choose any meal and say "It was all right"), select the Digestive (third option), and giving it to the person in the bar's bathroom.

**Workout Plan:** (Minigame) Make a save prior to playing the squat game in the gym. Get a feel for the timing in practice if you wish (or use the actual game for practice and reset if you don't get it). If you don't make a mistake and keep a good pace, you should hit the goal of 20 squats easily by the time requirement.

**Deep in the Decadent Backyard:** (Treasure) There are eight items in total to pick up in Sector 6 and the sewers. However, you can only get the first six in the initial visit and the remaining two during events in Disc 2. So make sure your measurement is at 6/8 prior to entering the Shinra Building. The first item is an Ether on the floor of the dungeon in Corneo's mansion where Tifa is located. The second item depends on wether Cloud was chosen by Don Corneo or not. It's a Hyper or Phoenix Down, depending on the situation. When Cloud is chosen, make sure to pick up the Hyper located behind Don Corneo's bed before talking to him! You have one other chance to get it before trying to leave his bedroom and falling down into the sewers as well. Item three is a Potion on the left after falling into the sewer. You can grab it before or after the boss fight. The fourth item is the Steal materia on the way through the sewers right after the boss fight.

**The Wonders of the Base (cont'd):** While in the Train Graveyard, we'll be grabbing more items for this achievement and completing it, provided that the two items in Sector 7's Beginner's Hall were obtained earlier. Go through the inside of the first train near the save crystal and check the barrel to find a Hi-Potion (item three). On top of that same train is another Hi-Potion (item four). Another barrel to the north has an echo screen (item five). Enter another train on the right and get the Potion inside (item six). Near the exit to the northern half of the graveyard is another Potion (item seven). Yet another Potion is to the left of the entrance after going around a train (item eight). Continue west around another train to another barrel, this one containing an Ether (item nine). Finally, a Hi-Potion (item ten) is found on top of a train between the two trains that can be moved to proceed to the graveyard's exit.

**Horseriders' Pride:** (Stealing) This is obtainable while in the northern half of the Train Graveyard. Make sure to equip the Steal materia obtained from the sewers and then steal the Striking Staff from the Eligor monster. Since it is a rarer encounter than others in the area, it's possible that you may not find an Eligor before reaching the exit. If that is the case, circle around near the exit until one shows up. In my case, I had about six encounters and ran from them all while my team built up their limit gauges. When it showed, it took about six attempts to do the steal (Tifa was my stealer). Once I got the staff and achievement, I unleashed limits (Aerith healed with Healing Wind and used the Fire spell) and defeated the fiend.

**The Ballad of Heisenberg:** (Meme) Another chance to get some grenades is from the shopkeeper at the base of the pillar, hiding near some scrap on the left middle of the screen.

**Deep in the Decadent Backyard (cont'd):** The next item for this achievement is the Sense materia found in the playground after the Sector 7 plate fell. You can pick it up after Barret and Tifa join Cloud before heading to see Marlene at Aerith's house, or on the way back to Wall Market to get to the Shinra Building.

**Good Things Happen For Those Who Wait:** Now is the time to get the Turbo Ether and this achievement from the kid, if you didn't take their hidden money stash. Grab it before or after returning to Aerith's house (but certainly before climbing up to the Shinra Building).

**Moulin a Cafe (cont'd):** Here is your final chance to read the first Turtle Paradise notice in the Turbo Ether kid's room!

**The Ballad of Heisenberg:** (Meme) Yet another chance to get some grenades from the Sector 5 Slums weapon shop.

**Deep in the Decadent Backyard (cont'd):** Pick up the other item in Don Corneo's mansion (Phoenix Down/Hyper) to get the sixth item. The remaining two and this achievement will be earned when returning to Midgar in Disc 2.

**Shinra Inc:** (Treasure) There are 32 items to find for this achievement. While climbing up the shining wire of hope to the Shinra Building, an Ether is obtained when using the last battery (accessible if you keep climbing past the swinging wire).

**The Elevator Champion/The Stairmaster:** (Mutually Exclusive) This is a perfect pair of achievements to split between the normal and **David and Goliath** runs. Storm the front and take the elevator in the normal run. Take the stairs for **David and Goliath**. Going in the front door also means that you can get the second Turtle's Paradise flyer for **Moulin a Cafe** and watch the ad for **Mako Motorworks**. I'm writing these notes taking the front door on the normal run. If you missed looking at the Turtle's Paradise flyer in this trip, like me even though I wrote this note to look at it, you have one more chance when you return to Midgar at the end of Disc 2!

**The Ballad of Heisenberg (cont'd):** If you didn't manage to buy a grenade or two, the Grenade Combatants you encounter in the first floor of the Shinra Building (if you opt to take the front door) can drop them.

**Mako Motorworks:** (Cutscene) Go up to the second floor and enter the museum/item shop area at the top right. Talk to the couple in front of the TV so they run away and then look at the TV to view the ad and get the achievement.

**The Elevator Champion:** This achievement unlocks once you reach the 59th floor via the elevator.

**Executive VIP:** (Treasure) Defeat the Mighty Grunts on the 59th floor to get Keycard 60 and the first of the five items for this achievement.

**Shinra Inc (cont'd):** After getting up to the 60th floor, you can head back down to the 59th and then go into the stairwell. Head down three screens and pick up an elixir for the second item. You can get this later, but it seems better to pick it up now.

**Without Arousing Suspicion:** (Minigame? Challenge?) This is a bit scary since there is no save point before this event. If you make a mistake, I'm not sure if the room resets if you are able to leave or not since I was able to get through this on my first try without getting an encounter. The first half is fairly simple since the guards pacing at the top are walking. The pair of guards on both sides follow a consistent pattern. Watch the pattern and leverage it to sneak past without being seen. The guards can only see when they are facing south. Once Cloud gets to the center, he signals to Barret and Tifa one at a time on when to run by. Press the Circle button at the moment the guards begin moving or when no guards are between the statues. The second set of guards run so the timing is tighter on when to signal. Just watch for them to start moving and press the button at the same time, being careful to not press the button too early. If you miss it on the normal run, you'll have to succeed during **David and Goliath** so there's a second opportunity if you'd rather wait.

**Executive VIP (cont'd):** Speak to the pacing person in the lounge to get Keycard 62.

**Top Quizzer:** (Minigame? Challenge?) Don't get help from the assistant and get the correct answer on the first try. The puzzle isn't too terribly difficult but there are plenty of guides out there, including [this one](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/faqs/71240/storyline-minigames#mayor-dominos-password), to tell you exactly how to figure out the answer easily. The correct way to play is to find the book that doesn't belong in each area of the library and the number on the book identifies the letter as part of the password. After completing the puzzle and providing the correct password, you'll get Keycard 65 (the third for **Executive VIP**), and the third item for **Shinra Inc** as well as this achievement for the first attempt. The Elemental materia from this achievement is also the first of three that will unlock the **The Possibility of Elemental Bliss** achievement.

**Shinra Inc (cont'd):** On the 63rd floor is a game where you can only open three doors to get three coupons. Follow the outer path around to the north and open the last door at the top heading left. Go to the end of the hallway and open the final door heading down. Enter the room to the left to get Coupon A. Enter the vent and go to the next room that had Coupon B in a bag. Open the final door to your left to get Coupon C and return to the machine to exchange it for a Star Pendant, Four Slots armor, and an All materia. Note that this only counts for one item in the counter for this achievement. Note that there is a save crystal on the next floor that you can access, in case you are concerned about the puzzle.

**Shinra Inc (cont'd):** On the 64th floor is a locker room. Open the two unlocked lockers (right side first and second rows) to get a Phoenix Down and Ether (items five and six). Make sure to examine the megaphone in another locker (third row left side) though Cloud won't pick it up and buy the "Shinra Gym Special Drink" in the vending machine and BANG on it when it doesn't dispense the drink to set up future items for this achievement on Disc 2.

**Executive VIP (cont'd):** Assemble the Midgar model to get Keycard 66. Only one remains!

**Battle Tested Blade:** (Stealing) The SOLDIER:3rd enemies on the 67th floor are the first opportunity to steal the Hardedge. Make sure to get this as soon as you can.

**Shinra Inc (cont'd):** On the 67th floor, you'll find Poison materia in a chest near the save crystal (item seven). After the fight with Sample: H0512 on the 68th floor, collect the Enemy Skill materia (item eight) which also awards **The Way of the Monster** and credit toward the first of the four materia needed for **The Possibility of Beastmastery**. Climb the stairs in the south of the lab to collect two potions on the walkway (item nine and ten).

**Executive VIP (cont'd):** Speak to the person north of the two potions on the lab walkway to get Keycard 68 and unlock the achievement.

**Fluss der Liebe:** (Cutscene) You can start preparing for this cutscene to be available by talking to Tifa in your shared jail cell repeatedly. You gain +1 affinity point for each time you say "Leave it to me" to her. I recommend keeping track of the amount of times so that you have an idea of how much you need to buff up Barret for the Gold Saucer date to get **Acoustic Fireworks**. However, this may be something to save for **David and Goliath**... Hmmm... It may be easier to do that instead. [This guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/faqs/2385) provides details of actions and responses throughout the game and their associated affinity changes. Yeah, I'm going to split it off between runs rather than try to get both in one run. So, I spoke to Tifa a ton here since I want to make sure I have over 50 affinity points near the end of the game. Using fast forward, I triggered the conversation and affinity gain 120 times. I'm sure it'll work out great!

**Shinra Inc (cont'd):** After getting out of jail, follow the blood trail toward two more potions (items 11 and 12). It looks like this is the last two items for now until Disc 2.

**The Ballad of Heisenberg (cont'd):** Time to pay the grenade fee and get this silly achievement... Throw one during the Rufus fight.

**Nuclear Cuttery:** (Stealing) The Custom Sweeper is found in the area surrounding Midgar. Steal the Atomic Scissors from them.

**Just a Friendly Pantyraid:** (Cutscene) Make sure to check the dresser in Tifa's room during the flashback event.

**Strago's Tribute:** (Materia? Not sure of the category yet...) The first enemy skill can be obtained from the Custom Sweeper as well: Matra Magic.

**The Possibility of Elemental Bliss:** (Materia?) During the flashback sequence, you can get an Elemental materia later on by checking Tifa's piano and saying "Yeah, I jammed on it" (second option). Play a few notes as well, just be sure.

**On the Outskirts:** (Treasure) There are 14 items to find across the three locations. The first is found in the inn at Kalm after the flashback event. Open the cabinet on the second floor near the stairs five times to get the megalixir. An Ether is in the house next to the inn in a door under the stairs (item two). The next house over has another Ether in a wardrobe on the second floor (item three). Yet another house over has a Guard Source in the wardrobe next to a child complaining about their brother on the second floor (item four). The circular stairs in the rear of the same house has the Peacemaker weapon in a chest for Vincent (item five). On the opposite side of the town square is another house with another Ether in a door under the stairs (item six). Once you arrive at the Chocobo Ranch, talk to the Chocobo right at the entrance and say "Wark" (first option) to get the Choco/Mog materia (item seven), which also goes toward **The Possibility of Avian Power**.

**DJ Chubby C. vs Go Go Boco!:** (Materia? I guess?) There is a 1 in 16 chance of getting the Fat Chocobo appearance so it may be worth it to attempt to get this near Kalm, where the inn is cheap for MP restoration. You can pass around the materia as well to get more casts of the summon before needing to rest and recover. Or you can just play through the game and roll your luck at getting the Fat Chocobo on occasion. Fort Condor has a free rest area too, so that could be an even better spot to try and get this.

**Basilisk Run:** (Challenge) There are a lot of strategies out there to be able to defeat the Midgar Zolom and get the Beta enemy skill early in the game. Since the fiend respawns in the swamp after it is killed by the party, Beta is not missable. Using Barret's Mindblow limit break is a way to prevent Midgar Zolom from using Beta so that you can survive the fight. If you put the party in the back row, have a dedicated healer, and use magic to deal damage as well as inflicting poison with the Bio spell to deal damage over time. Getting the Sadness status is also beneficial to mitigate damage. The exact strategy I used was to cast Bio with Cloud to poison and do damage, Tifa used Matra Magic, and Barret healed and tanked while firing off Big Shots until the monster died.

**Strago's Tribute (cont'd):**
  - Getting Beta early is great and not too difficult to do though some patience and luck with timing is required (unless you grind levels). Make use of the Sadness status on the character with the Enemy Skill materia. Put Fire-Elemental linked materia on that character's armor as well. Placing a Talisman accessory can further reduce damage. Hit the Midgar Zolom with Bio to poison the fiend, use limits as they come up, and defend with the Enemy Skill materia equipped character. Once a character is ejected, Beta can occur as a counter attack. Once Beta is learned, cast it back. Midgar Zolom should die or be close to dying from poison. This took a few tries to get... Timing played a big part in this. Give it a few attempts and adjust strategy to attempt to bait the Beta attack while also having done enough damage to retaliate with Beta as well and knock out the remaining HP in one shot. I was able to succeed with Cloud at Level 14 with around 550 HP. On my successful attempt, when Beta hit, Cloud had 100-ish HP remaining and Midgar Zolom did another physical attack for about 80 HP before I could attack with Beta and win the fight.
  - L4 Suicide can be obtained from the Mu fiend found in the grass areas surrounding the Chocobo Ranch. You don't have to have a character at a level with a multiple of 4 to get the enemy skill. Once you find an encounter with a Mu, leave the Mu alone until it uses the skill. When you see the notification that you learned it, win the battle.
  - Chocobuckle is obtained from chocobos at critical health. Since we are at the Chocobo Ranch area, this is the first and best opportunity to get this enemy skill. The best way to do this is to use the L4 Suicide enemy skill you just learned on a chocobo so that it can counter with the move before it runs away! You could use a Mimett Green to keep the chocobo around for a bit and use Sense to see the level but that's slow and expensive to guess with. Chocobos are guaranteed to be a level at a multiple of four if it is accompanied by two Levikrons or two Elfadunks. When you see that enemy formation, place a Mimett green, use L4 Suicide, and the chocobo will counter with Chocobuckle on the Enemy Skill materia user. Note that you do have to use a Mimett Green because the chocobo will just run away if you use something less than that.
  - Flame Thrower can be obtained from an Ark Dragon in the Mythril Mine. This is just a matter of luck that the person with the Enemy Skill materia gets targeted.

**On the Outskirts (cont'd):** After entering the Mythril Mine, go to the right and pick up an Ether on the ground and tent in a chest (items eight and nine). Climb the vines near the stairs to grab a Long Range materia (item ten). Back at the entrance, head south and to the left to grab a chest with a Mind Source (item 11). After continuing down the path and chatting with the Turks, head north through the archway to find an elixir in a chest and Hi-Potion on the ground (items 12 and 13). The last item and the achievement will be much later, on Disc 2, when you get a free Chocobo Lure materia at the Chocobo Ranch.

**A Tougher Grab:** (Stealing) The Madouge is found in the Mythril Mine.

The Mythril Mine and the forests of the Junon area appear to be an ideal location to start unlocking Limit Breaks for characters. Getting encounters with large groups of enemies and using Beta are great for getting enemy kills on a character who is trying to get to a new Limit Break level. When trying to unlock a second limit break in a level, use Hyper to put that character in a Fury status and let a battle run to build up damage and limit gauge while other characters heal. Cloud can mostly be ignored for grinding since he is required in the party almost all the time. Later in the game, you can come here for killing lots of enemies quickly as well.

**Comes Right Back To You:** (Stealing) Formula fiends are found in the plains of the Junon area, after leaving the Mythril Mine.

**Tower Defense 101:** (Minigame) This can be paired with **David and Goliath**. You start with the first game right after the Mythril Mine, the second one immediately after saving Priscilla, then the third after getting the Shiva materia from Priscilla. They are very close together and easily missed! I'm going to attempt to make it part of my normal playthrough unless I miss something... Since this is also Huge Materia related, if this is deferred to **David and Goliath**, you'd have to get all four Huge Materia in that run to get **WOW! They're HUGE!** so it is ideal to get it in the normal run.
  - The first event isn't terribly difficult. Mostly beasts are encountered with a couple of wyverns. Using attackers, a defender or two, and a couple of shooters should be more than enough to take out the enemies. You get Red XIII's Magic Comb weapon, which is nice for materia growth.

**Last Resort:** (Challenge) Just let the enemies during the Fort Condor tower defense game reach the top to fight CMD. Grand Horn. Defeat it and get this achievement. Doing this doesn't increment the measure for **Tower Defense 101** so only go for this if you don't care for getting that achievement or if you have saved prior to the minigame and can revert back to try the battle again.

**The Ninja Joins the Team:** (Side Quest?) The earliest you can get Yuffie is also right after the Mythril Mine. She can be found in any forest (chances are low initially so persistence is needed if she isn't showing up). After defeating the Mystery Ninja in battle, approach her and answer the following: "Not interested", "......petrified", "Wait a second!", "......that's right", and "Let's hurry on".

**Ravaging Reptile:** (Challenge) This may require some preparation to unlock limit breaks that will do enough damage as well as character levels. Or maybe just have Fury status and the HP to tank hits... Let's give it a shot. Yep! It took a couple of tries, but this strategy worked with Cloud, Yuffie (both level 18), and Barret (level 16). All characters had all materia removed, strongest weapons equipped (stolen from enemies), and carbon bangles for armor. Some luck was involved with limit breaks having crits and characters with lower HP getting bubbled, but I managed to get the boss on my sixth try. Fast forward makes repeated attempts inconsequential.

**Tower Defense 101 (cont'd):** The next two battles are right now!
  - The second event starts right after saving Priscilla and resting at the house that is offered. When you awake and the music for the parade has begun, leave Under Junon and head back to Fort Condor alone. The second event has a mix of barbarians, wyverns, and beasts. A mix of fighters, defenders, and shooters is more than enough. Swap attackers for fighters if you'd like, but the fighters are more than enough for the beasts at a cheaper cost. A Peace Ring accessory is your reward.
  - The third event will be available right after talking to Priscilla and receiving the Shiva materia (and getting the **A N-ice Gift** achievement), then heading down to the beach and getting the whistle. Again, Cloud goes to Fort Condor alone for this new tower defense battle. There is a good reward here for letting the enemy get to the top, but you don't get credit toward this achievement for that, so you'll have to win and get the lesser three ethers prize instead. I used the same strategy as the last battle, but needed a couple more units than before.

**The Imperial March:** (Minigame) There is a save crystal in the hallway just before going out to the parade. The march is a bit tricky to get right. Run in front of the row that you join, despite what the commander tell you and fall into the rank. Press the Circle button to salute the rifle in time with the other soldiers in the parade. It sounds like just mashing the button is even more helpful and just getting lined up is the key. Okay, mashing didn't really work for me. A rhythmic tapping was more effective at getting the rating up while lined up. This may take a couple of tries to get the feel for the event and get the >50% rating.

**Of Shores and Sea:** (Treasure) There are 24 items to find for this achievement. After going through the parade and re-entering the street, the last door is a housing area. Talk to the guard in the room to enter the Respectable Inn. An Enemy Skill materia is on the ground (item one) and would be the second of four for **The Possibility of Beastmastery**. Head out of the Respectable Inn and go up to the second floor. Grab the 1/35 Soldier toy, a Mind Source, and a Luck Source (items two through four). Go upstairs again and get the Power Source and Guard Source (items five and six). Go past a few screens to more doors and enter the third door (past the number "59" on the wall). There is a Speed Source on the floor in the first floor room (item seven). Go upstairs and grab another 1/35 Soldier toy (item eight). Make sure you have a Tranquilizer in your inventory before going to the dock. The item shop in Junon has them for sale.

**Sea Breeze Concerto:** (Minigame) Reset after getting this achievement to get the second place prize instead (HP Plus materia). The first place prize is a Force Stealer weapon, which will be obtained fairly soon and HP Plus is quite valuable to get leveled up. The game isn't terribly challenging to get right though. There is a save point at the nearby inn (the door that has the number "59" on the wall near it). Take advantage of the save to get a feel for how it works. It seems like if you are close on the timing, you'll get 10 points. If you are off a little bit, you'll get 5 points (if your timing is off a bit twice in a row, you'll see the 10 points, but it only increments in 10 points). This scoring system isn't exact, but it seems pretty close to what happens. However, you'll get no points if the timing is completely off, press the wrong button, or are facing the wrong direction (wrong facing overrides any button prompts that have good timing so realign yourself immediately). If you want the HP Plus (60-90 points) and are approaching 100, just don't do anything. The points never seem to go down. Also, the special finisher earns 30 points if timed decently and direction doesn't matter.

**Of Shores and Sea (cont'd):** On the ship, open the chest for an Ether (item nine). Talk to the sailor blocking access to a materia, who is Yuffie in disguise, and give her the Tranquilizer we needed. She'll move out of the way for that materia soon. After the alarm goes off and you form a party, you'll be able to get the All materia that Yuffie was blocking earlier (item ten). In the engine room, before approaching the Jenova fight, climb the ladder and grab the Wind Slash weapon from the chest (item 11). Notably, the Ifrit materia found after the Jenova fight does not count toward this achievement. Make sure you pick it up anyway for the **Summon Master** achievement later!

**Research and a Tan:** (Cutscene) Upon arriving in Costa Del Sol, make sure Tifa is NOT in your party. If she was in your party on the cargo ship, you can PHS her out of the party by leaving town for the world map (this is necessary for the following event). Now, go to the beach and speak with Hojo to get this achievement.

**Do I Detect Some Tension?:** (Cutscene) After the Hojo cutscene, go to the door that is under the sign that says "Bar del sol" (Red XIII will be near the door if not in your party). Inside, you'll find Johnny and Tifa having a chat. Go into the room and Tifa asks you to give them some privacy. Talk to Tifa and after the conversation the achievement will unlock.

**Coal and Gold Miner:** (Treasure) There are 14 items to find for this achievement. Enter the first door across the bridge after leaving the Costa del Sol port and go downstairs into the cellar. Inside a chest is a fire ring accessory and there is a motor drive and Power Source on the ground (items one through three).

**Carbonated Comb:** (Stealing) Bagnadrana are encountered in the Mt. Corel area. I found my first one on the second screen of the area. I also saw them at the reactor. Additionally, stock up on Right Arms by stealing them from Bombs at the large suspension bridge near the end of the area. They will be useful later.

**Coal and Gold Miner (cont'd):** After the reactor and running down the tracks of Mt. Corel, you'll see a save crystal. Use it! Now proceed to the fork and take the upper path of tracks. A weak point will fall out. DON'T JUMP OFF! If you do, reset and reload your save. While falling, hold left and repeatedly tap Circle. You grab onto scaffolding and climb to reach a Wizard Staff (item four). When you climb back out, the end of the upper track has a chest with a "W Machine Gun" weapon (item five). Now take the lower path and fall down a weak section again, holding right and tapping Circle. Climb the scaffolding and get a Star Pendant accessory (item six). You can now jump from any other weak track sections at this point. After reaching the next track junction, backtrack on the upper path to find a Turbo Ether and Transform materia (items seven and eight). Take the upper path to the right and lower the drawbridge. Past the cabin that lets you lower the drawbridge is a spot on the wall to climb. You'll find a nest. Take the treasure of ten Phoenix Downs and a battle (item nine) along with **Reverie of the Broken Phoenix** achievement. Head back to the lower track with the drawbridge, go around the bend, then take the left fork and enter a cave. Get the Tent from the treasure chest as well as the Mind Source and Power Source (items 10-12). In North Corel, enter the tent on the right near the lower right exit. An Ether is in a pot in the top right corner of the tent, though it is tricky to get to with the person pacing around back by it (item 13). That is the last item you can get until after the Gold Saucer date.

**Wrestling with Double Bass:** (Minigame) In Wonder Square's arm wrestling minigame, choose the Wrestler option. I recommend setting up turbo/auto-fire for the Circle button to cheese this, unless you are really good at mashing. You can get this on your first visit to Gold Saucer.

**Space Jam**: (Minigame) This game seemed intimidating at first but then I figured out a consistent method to get the hoop every time. Let go of the Circle button as the top of the ball lines up with the large hair spike on Cloud's head. I captured the moment in the super-dunk-lineup.png screenshot.

**Love Story**: (Minigame) A very simple minigame where you just give Mog the moogle some nuts. Feed him until he is happy twice to win and get the achievement. You can get this on your first visit to Gold Saucer.

**The Rules of the Road:** (Minigame) The goal is to get over 10,000 points and earn the Speed Source prize to get the achievement. Bikes come out in waves, three bikes each. Orange bikes will head right toward the truck while red bikes will try to avoid you and pull you away from the truck so other bikes (orange or red) can attack the truck. Try to stay near the truck and only pull away when red bikes need to be aggressively removed to start a new wave. If possible, use the orange bikes to create a chain reaction that takes out others, especially the red bikes. Staying near the truck will get orange bikes in a position where they can possibly hit other bikes as they slide away when hit by you. Overall, I don't think this is too tough to complete, but I can see how some may have problems. Ultimately, be aggressive while protecting the truck as much as possible and you'll eventually get this. You can get this on your first visit to Gold Saucer.

**Moulin a Cafe (cont'd)**: The third flyer is found in the Haunted Hotel to the right of the door to the hotel's item shop.

**Dragon's Run**: (Minigame) Getting 5000 points in the Speed Square minigame is no simple task. Many guides mention memorization of where targets appear so that you know where to position the cursor ahead of time, and that advice is definitely sound. Set up a save point at the Ropeway Station (costs 5GP to use though) so that you can practice the minigame as much as you want for only the one 10GP cost and resetting after each attempt. Setting up turbo/auto-fire for this game is also recommended to give your hands a break with repeated attempts. I had seen guides state that you should use a lower rate of triggering the Circle button, but a one frame rapid fire did the trick for me. As much as I loathe the site, the Fandom FF7 wiki page for [Speed Square](https://antifandom.com/finalfantasy/wiki/Speed_Square) does give a list of all the qualifying targets and their point values. Key targets to look out for:
  - the boulder near the end of the cactus/desert area: worth 200 points. It is hard to see without perhaps checking out a video of it's location, but I have a picture of it here (speed-square-boulder.png). About three-quarters of the way through the section, the upper wall of the canyon contains the boulder. Position the cursor on the right side, along the top of the wall and fire to eventually hit it.
  - Water wheel of steamboat: variable points. The steamboat appears after the first submarine jumps out of the water. Target down low and begin firing at the wheel but don't follow after it to keep getting more points. It's counterintuitive but it works well.
  - Balloons: 30 points each. There's a LOT of them, they pop with one shot, and they are grouped up to hit a bunch in one blast. You should be able to hit nearly all of them for a good helping of points.
  - Boss UFO: 1000 points. You can't miss it since the roller coaster stops at it. Center your cursor and just rapidly tap Circle (or use turbo/auto-fire). The UFO will back off and can't be hit for a little bit but will return once more to take fire until it blows up. As long as you keep your cursor in the center or slightly right of center, you'll hit it when it returns and it will go down with a high rate of maximum power shots.
  - Final spotlight: 200 points. As the roller coaster approaches the final turn, spotlights begin to turn upwards toward the sky. Move the cursor into the bottom right corner (I've seen people say bottom left as well, but I couldn't quite get the positioning there to hit it for some reason). Once you get in range of the spotlights, begin holding the Circle button (not turbo/auto-fire in this case!) and let your power drain. Hold it through the bend and eventually you'll destroy the spotlight and get the final points.

**Strago's Tribute (cont'd):** Death Claws can be found in the desert before fighting Dyne. They can use Laser, which can be learned on your Enemy Skill materia. Since you now have multiple of the materia, make sure you have learned it at least on the one that has learned the earlier skills to ensure that you get one materia with all the skills. Feel free to learn it on both, however.

**Summon Master**: (Materia) Make sure to pick up the Ramuh materia in the jockey locker room prior to the Chocobo Race!

**Tower Defense 101 (cont'd):** The fourth Fort Condor battle is available after getting out of Corel Prison and getting the buggy. Cross the ocean via Costa Del Sol and return to Fort Condor to start the battle. This one is a bit more complicated than the previous two battles and has 10 more units (30 total) to defeat. This is the first fight where the guard you speak to in order to start the battle recommends using Fire Catapults. They seemed to work well at handling the increased amount of enemy units as long as you micromanage support attackers/defenders/shooters, but it is probably manageable just using them without the catapults. Make sure you have enough funds to handle adding additional units if you need them since pay-to-win is a legitimate strategy.

**Prayer**: (Characters? That might be a good category name for learning limits/getting ultimate weapons...) In order to get Great Gospel for Aerith, you'll need Mythril. To get some, there is a dude sleeping in a cave to the east of Junon. Talk to him when the number of battles you have won has matching odd numbers in the tens and ones digits: 133, 155, 177, etc. This is in preparation for being able to get the limit break once we have Tiny Bronco, but you might as well pick up the mythril now while here for Fort Condor.

**Strago's Tribute (cont'd):** Time to get more enemy skills!
  - White Wind: the Zemzelett, found in the Junon region, can be compelled to use the skill when Manipulate is used on them. It's probably useful to have both Enemy Skill materia equipped.
  - Big Guard: Beachplugs are found on the coast near Costa Del Sol. Manipulate them to have them cast it on the party. I highly recommend getting this skill on both Enemy Skill materia!
  - Aqualung: A Harpy can be found in the desert surrounding the Gold Saucer while in the buggy. Use Big Guard for protection since the skill is basically Beta for the water element. Add Sadness effect if you are having trouble surviving as well. After the materia has learned it, kill the Harpy quickly (and/or heal!) because it will kill you if it uses the skill again.

**Double Kill!**: (Side Quest) Go to Gongaga, in the forest containing wreckage south of Gold Saucer, and defeat Reno and Rude. Save outside of the forest before hand, just in case. This can be missed if you go to Cosmo Canyon first, so make sure you stop at Gongaga first. The key to this is that they BOTH have to be defeated. If one goes down, the other will run away in a turn. So, bust out the big enemy skills: Aqualung and Beta! Use other multi-target spells or summons if you have them as well, or just defend if a character can't hit both at once. Both Turks have 2000 HP so you can track the damage and single target if they are getting close to 0 HP. Overall though, not too tough.

**Summon Master (cont'd)**: Pick up the Titan materia in the wreckage of the Gongaga reactor. After watching the cutscene with Scarlet and Tseng, walk by where she was standing and commenting on huge materia to find something shiny and choose "Reach for it" (second option). This is also the first item toward the **Forestry and Mountain Travel** Treasure achievement.

**Forestry and Mountain Travel**: (Treasure) There are 15 items for this achievement. Along the path heading toward Gongaga, there is a fork in the road. A yellow materia is found on the ground on the left fork, which is Deathblow materia (item two). The northwest building in Gongaga proper has a chest with an X-Potion (item three). In the house next to the inn is another chest, this one containing the White Megaphone weapon (item four).

**Strago's Tribute (cont'd)**: Look for the frog fiend called "Touch Me". Either manipulate or wait for it to use Frog Song on one or both Enemy Skill materia users to learn the skill and win the battle. I found one on the path outside of Gongaga, where the Deathblow materia is.

**Tower Defense 101 (cont'd)**: DO NOT MOVE THE BUGGY NEAR COSMO CANYON!!! In order to not miss the fifth battle, you need to have donated 3000 gil, or do the events in Cosmo Canyon while leaving the buggy parked a distance away so that it doesn't break down. You can get pretty close with it breaking down. To be safe, I went up the path and got out at the turn back that leads to the village entrance, walking the rest of the way in.

**Acoustic Fireworks**: (Cutscene) If you intend to do the Gold Saucer date with Barret, you will need to have him in your party when you first enter Cosmo Canyon if you need to manipulate his affinity. When the party splits up, Barret will be in the room behind Tiger Lily's Weapon Shop. Save your game and then chat with Barret to discuss Avalanche. If you say "Go on" (first option), Barret gains +3 affinity. If you then say "Yeah, whatever..." (second option), you can leave the room and reenter to do the conversation over again. Repeat this, gaining +3 affinity each time, to quickly get Barret's affinity up high enough to go on the date with him. Again, this can be done either on the normal or **David and Goliath** playthrough.

**Forestry and Mountain Travel (cont'd)**: Go into the Cosmo Canyon inn and enter the inn's bedroom. Examine the refrigerator on the left to get an Elixir (item six? Where was item five then???).

**Moulin a Cafe (cont'd)**: Flyer #5 is found near the door next to the inn counter. Flyer #4 is in the Tiger Lily Weapon Shop, on the pole between the stairs and the shop counter.

**Tower Defense 101 (cont'd)**: Once you have joined up with Red XIII to go into the Gi Cave, you can leave Cosmo Canyon for the fifth battle at Fort Condor. Again, this will only work if you haven't let the buggy get damaged. You can also have paid 3000 gil ahead of time to allow them to fund the battle and get credit toward the achievement, but your money is best saved up for later battles when you can't get to Fort Condor. The guard in the shack that starts the battle has the same advice as from the fourth battle so deploy similar tactics as that one for this fifth.

**Strago's Tribute (cont'd)**: Gi Spector or Sneaky Step will use Death Sentence. You can manipulate them to ensure that the action is taken and used on the correct characters with the Enemy Skill materia.

Potential preparation for **June Bug** later: While in the Gi Cave, fighting Sneaky Steps have a chance of dropping M-Tentacles, which cast Bio3. If you have some Deadly Waste from your time in Midgar, those can be useful as well. Getting Materia Keeper poisoned is helpful in defeating it with only items on top of the damage the spells do, so having these two will help immensely.

**Forestry and Mountain Travel (cont'd)**: Open the hidden path north by breaking the third strange rock, then loop around to the left and south and pick up the Added Effect materia (item seven). This is very important to get as it is the only one in the game and defeating the boss locks this dungeon out from reentry. You'll need it for the **Support Master** achievement! Back in the room with the oil slicks and forking paths, open the two treasure chests to get the Black Megaphone weapon and an Ether (items eight and nine). Heading further north is a room with five paths. The second path from the right has an X-Potion in a chest (item ten). Double back and take the second path from the left. After the Stinger fight, head left and south and take a hidden path right to a chest with a Fairy Ring accessory (item 11). Finally, fight the final Stinger and go around the rock formation to the left to get a Turbo Ether in a chest (item 12). This is the last item until Disc 2 for this achievement. The Gravity materia found after defeating Gi Nattak does not count toward this.

**No One-Way Ticket**: (Challenge) You cannot use the instant death healing items and spells on Gi-Nattak. This means that you can use Hi-Potions and the Cure spells. Other possibilities are to use summons, Beta (for Gi Nattak), Ice spells (for the Soul Flames), and regular attacks. If you have multi-target Cure spells, make sure to save them for your party if needed by shifting to single target. There is no save crystal before the boss fight so prepare yourself prior to entering the door to the north past the third Stinger. Note that you can't use any of these items or spells AT ALL, not even on your own party. That complicates things considerably... Keep people healthy to avoid any characters dying or be aggressive and take out Gi Nattak quickly. I opted for the latter, ignoring the Soul Flames.

**Tower Defense 101 (cont'd)**: After the Gi Cave, the sixth battle is available at Fort Condor. Take the buggy back to Costa Del Sol/Junon to get there and talk to the guard. He makes the same recommendation again as with battles four and five.

**Nibel Visitors**: (Treasure) There are 27 items to find for this achievement. Upon entering Nibelheim, go to the inn and it's backroom. A man in black robes is holding a Luck Source and gives it to you (item one). Another man in black robes is in the item shop next door, near the furnace to the right, giving you an Elixir (item two). In Tifa's old house, in the kitchen area is another man in black robes who gives you a Turbo Ether (item three). Upstairs, in Tifa's parents bedroom, a man in black robes gives you the Platinum Fist weapon (item four). You can play the Final Fantasy VII main theme on Tifa's piano, but the secret stash does not count toward the treasure achievement, so you can skip it. In the second floor of the house in the bottom left corner, talk to a kid in black robes near the top of the stairs to get another Luck Source (item five).

**Strago's Tribute (cont'd)**: Get into a fight with a Jersey inside Shinra Manor, who will potentially use ???? if not damaged. So just tank the spin attacks until the main Enemy Skill materia gets the skill added. The skill is not in the manipulate list, so you just have to be patient, unfortunately.

**Nibel Visitors (cont'd)**: The next set of items are found in Shinra Manor. While not required to enter now, you'll probably want to since Lost Number must be defeated on Disc 1 for the **True Workout** achievement, unless you are going for **David and Goliath** obviously. Go through the door on the right by the base of the stairs and to a room with another chest containing the Silver Megaphone weapon (item six). Head through the central door on the first floor and go right and up to the chest to find the Twin Viper weapon (item seven). Up on the second floor, head straight left to find a chest with the Enemy Launcher weapon (item eight).

More possible preparation for **June Bug**: Try to fight Mirages to get a Mirror drop from them.

**True Workout**: (Challenge) Open the safe and start the fight with Lost Number. The requirements for this battle are that you have to be on Disc 1 (so you will have lower levels and equipment, potentially) and that you must fight the physical attacking half of the creature midway through the fight. This means that you must use physical attacks during the first half of the fight until the boss turns purple. Once purple, follow up with magical based attacks. Your strongest spells at this point are Beta or Aqualung. Big Guard is a must here as well to mitigate damage AND get more turns in between Lost Number's attacks. There is NO primed achievement notification that I noticed during this fight, so if the achievement didn't unlock when you land the killing blow, reset and try again. The other condition is that you cannot have paralyzed the boss (I assume that Stop counts toward this as well). Make sure your attacks and magic don't have an added paralysis effect!

**Forbidden Memory (of a Forgotten Dream)**: (Characters?) Lost Number drops the Cosmo Memory item for Red XIII's final limit break. You may not have all prior limit breaks unlocked by this point. Additionally, there have been reports of issues with the achievement unlocking on discs earlier than Disc 3. So, make sure to save prior to using it. If I get all of Red's limit breaks prior to Disc 3, I'll try and see myself.

**Nibel Visitors (cont'd)**: Defeating Lost Number gives you the Key to the Basement (item nine). The Odin materia also drops out (item ten).

**The Norse God of Many Faces**: (Materia? Side Quest?) Pick up the Odin materia after defeating Lost Number.

**Nibel Visitors (cont'd)**: On the right side of the manor's second floor is a chest in the northern room with a Mind Source (item 11). Finally, in the library, after a discussion with Sephiroth, pick up the Destruct materia he throws at Cloud (item 12).

**A Dark Invitation**: (Materia? Side Quest?) Get the Destruct materia that Sephiroth throws at Cloud in the Shinra Manor basement library.

**Of Transformants and Brevity**: (Side Quest) Get Vincent to join your party. Using the Key to the Basement, talk to Vincent in his casket. Choose "Talk about Sephiroth" (second option). Talk to him again and choose "Who are you?" (second option). See Sephiroth in the library and then try to leave the basement. Vincent will stop you and ask to join the group, unlocking the achievement.

**Nibel Visitors (cont'd)**: While following the path through the Mt. Nibel area on the first screen, a split in the path heads up into the mountains to a chest with a Rune Blade weapon (item 13). Another split path is near the rope bridge, heading up into another set of mountains. Climb the winding paths to reach another chest with the Plus Barrette weapon (item 14).

**Treasure Hoard**: (Stealing) After the rope bridge is a room with pipes and is also the room where Dragons can be first encountered. Steal the Gold Armlet from them for the achievement (and better armor for the whole party). If you are concerned about surviving, you can manipulate them and then steal, running away after getting the armor.

**Nibel Visitors (cont'd)**: Take the pipe labeled number 4 to get to a chest with All materia in it (item 15). Take the south exit (to the left of the Materia Keeper), jump down and enter the cave, and take the meandering path to reach a chest with an Elixir (item 16). In the room with the naturally occurring materia fountain (from the flashback), pick up the Elemental materia in the water (item 17), which is also the second of three toward unlocking **The Possibility of Elemental Bliss**. The next room has the Sniper CR weapon in a chest by taking the left path at a fork (item 18). Skip past the reactor to reenter the pipe room and lower the ladder. Climb back up to the pipes and there the one labeled number 2 to get the Powersoul weapon (item 19).

**June Bug**: (Challenge) Because the boss has Trine and you'll want it on at least one Enemy Skill materia, I recommend using the save crystal and re-fighting this boss after getting this achievement, so that you don't have to worry about trying to do both at once as well as keeping your item supply after the fact. However, if you do manage to get both at once, nice! If you followed my tip at the Gi Cave, you should have a few M-Tentacles, or even some Deadly Waste on you. These will be used to put Materia Keeper in a poison state. With 8400 HP, Materia Keeper will lose 262 HP for every poison tick. Use the remaining damage items to attack the boss. Using the poison damage only will prevent Materia Keeper from using Trine and healing itself so attack it with additional items only if you want to. If you happened to get a Mirror from Shinra Manor's Mirage enemies, use one to put Reflect on Materia Keeper to prevent it from curing itself and supplementing your own healing. If you have the Bolt Ring accessory from the old man who gives you Mythril near Junon, put that onto one character to ensure someone can survive and heal (preferably the one with the main Enemy Steal materia equipped). Use Lightning-Elemental materia on armor on another character as well to reduce damage. Back row all of your party. Sadness could help as well. Worst case, if you aren't able to proc poison with one or two Bio casting items and you don't have any other items to do the damage, just reset and try again until the poison status lands and then let the poison do the work while you defend.

**Nibel Visitors (cont'd)**: After Materia Keeper is killed, it drops a Counter materia on the ground (item 20).

This is a good point to continue to get Limit Breaks unlocked. Kyuvilduns can appear in packs of 5, sometimes with Twin Brains. You can double it up with getting more Gold Armlets from Dragons. Additionally, in the grasslands around Nibelheim and Rocket Town, you can come across packs of three Nibel Wolves. Killing one or two can permit them to call in a replacement and so you can rack up some kills that way as well.

**Gambling**: (Characters? Limit Breaks?) The easiest limit break based achievement to unlock. Just kill 40 enemies with Cait Sith to get the Slots limit break and this achievement.

**Nerdy Hobby**: (Treasure) Speak with the old man a couple of times outside of the Rocket Town item shop to get the Yoshiyuki weapon. This is also item 21 for **Nibel Visitors**. This is missable because after a certain point in Disc 2 (not clear what event does it), the old man is no longer available or doesn't give the weapon any more. So make sure to get it on your first visit.

**Nibel Visitors (cont'd)**: In the rightmost house in Rocket Town, open the chest in the kitchen to get a Power Source (item 22). In the house north of that, there is a chest with the Drill Arm weapon (item 23).

**Tower Defense 101 (cont'd)**: It's time for the seventh battle at Fort Condor! A very inopportune time, you have to participate after walking out the back side of the house that the Drill Arm was in, the party remarks on the Tiny Bronco and speaks with Shera. This is the point that the Fort Condor battle becomes available and only until you have spoken to the "Captain": Cid. So the window is very small! Either have paid the 3000 gil ahead of time or make the long trek back to Fort Condor to participate. The journey back is another opportunity to unlock more limit breaks. The guard at the shack has new advice this time around, stating that you should deploy tri-stoners and that's it. The tri-stoners are helpful in protecting the three main lanes enemies can pass through, though shooters will be necessary for taking down wyverns. Add supporting fighters/attackers/defenders as necessary. By this point, if you've been working on building up your limit breaks, you'll probably have more than enough money to fund the necessary troops and win this battle.

**Poki no Tema**: (Challenge) Prepare by getting the limit gauge filled up on all characters. By this point, you should have Aerith's Fury Brand, so if you are concerned that your party won't be able to do 6000 HP of damage with three limit breaks or withstand the attacks to build up the gauges again, try using Fury Brand to get four limit breaks easily. As always, save before entering Rocket Town and initiating the fight in case things don't work right so that you can adjust your strategy. Another good candidate for the fight is Vincent's limit break since he automatically acts after transforming it won't count against the achievement's requirements. Vincent can just attack and everyone else stands by in the back row.

**Tower Defense 101 (cont'd)**: Sure enough, the eighth battle is available right after escaping in the Tiny Bronco! Getting there is much quicker now too. The hint provided by the guard in the shack is the same as the last battle as well. While I'm unsure of the number of enemy units, there does seem to be more of them than the previous battle.

**Prayer (cont'd)**: With the Tiny Bronco and the Mythril, you can also pick up the Great Gospel item at the arms dealer's place near Gongaga. After giving the dealer the Mythril, you can go upstairs to the opening on the wall to get the limit break item. Aerith won't be able to use it unless she has all prior limit breaks unlocked however. I got them all prior to Rocket Town and was able to unlock Great Gospel once I got the item, along with the achievement. Getting this will make **Battle Symphony** easier.

**Strago's Tribute (cont'd)**: Time to get a couple more enemy skills while in Wutai
  - From where you can land with the Tiny Bronco, head to the patch of grass to the southeast. Find the Razor Weed encounter and manipulate it to use Magic Hammer on your Enemy Skill materia equipped characters and win the battle.
  - On the beach itself, get into a fight with an Adamantaimai. Manipulate it and use Death Force on your characters then win the battle. Also feel free to steal Adaman Bangles from them while they are manipulated!

**Moulin a Cafe (con't)**: When you enter Wutai, the Turtle's Paradise pub is across two bridges to the left. Make sure to check the sign outside the pub that mentions the publicity campaign to find the flyers throughout the world.

**Ancient and Leviathan Goods**: (Treasure) There are 28 items to find for this achievement. The Wutai item shop has a chest with an MP Absorb materia (item one). While you'll get credit for the achievement, you'll promptly lose the materia right after opening the chest. Heading toward the pagoda, enter the house on the right and then go into the room where you can rest. There is a hidden passage behind a curtain to the left that holds a chest with a Magic Shuriken (item two). Head back to the hallway outside the rest room and enter the next door. There is a hidden passage via a rotating wall to the south that leads to a chest with a Hairpin (item three).

**Moulin a Cafe (cont'd)**: After cornering Yuffie in the pot and the cutscene that follows, follow her downstairs. Before heading toward the purple carpet she is standing on, you'll find Turtle's Paradise flyer 6 on the wall next to the door, opposite the staircase. That should be all of the flyers! Head back to the Turtle's Paradise pub and speak with the bartender behind the counter to collect your reward and this achievement.

**Ancient and Leviathan Goods (cont'd)**: After tracking down Yuffie and witnessing her kidnapping, open the two chests to get a Swift Bolt and Elixir (items four and five). As you chase after Don Corneo, go north at two forks to find Rude in front of a cave, inside of which is a chest with a Dragoon Lance weapon (item six).

**Quite the Rapps-scallion**: This is required to be fought on Disc 1, so coming to Wutai right after getting the Tiny Bronco is a good idea. However, you are going to lose most or all of your materia. Stealing Adaman Bangles prior to this fight will help a lot (big defense improvement with only two materia slots). Having a lot of items on hand to provide healing, since you probably don't have any magic materia, will be necessary so stock up on Hi-Potions. Without magic and limits, all you have is attack and item. If you got T/S Bombs from the Flapbeats in the Gold Saucer area, these will be very effective against Rapps. It may be worth it to head back there and stock up before losing your materia as you progress through Wutai. They take 3000 HP on the first use(Rapps has 6000 HP). You can use another to knock off an additional 1500 HP, leaving that much left to take out with other attack items, such as the Fire Veil and Swift Bolts you can purchase at the Wutai item shop or Right Arms you may have stolen from Bombs, or physical weapon attacks. Rapps' Aero3 spell will do a ton of damage though, so make sure to heal after those attacks.

**Materia Junkie**: (Side Quest) This is missable because the events in Wutai will be locked out during Disc 3. Since you are near Wutai when you first get the Tiny Bronco, its a perfect time to get the quest done. The achievement is awarded after the cutscene where you get your materia back, along with the MP Absorb materia from the Wutai item shop chest. Some may prefer to do this after Temple of the Ancients, but with the **Ancient Steps Retraced** challenge achievement, it's good to knock out as many side quests as possible to get strong enough to do that challenge.

**Shuriken Contest/Ninja of the Gods**: (Side Quest/Challenge) Yuffie solos the best fighters in Wutai, including her father. To get Ninja of the Gods, this must be done during Disc 1 without leaving the Pagoda. 
  - My setup on Yuffie: Level 36. Razor Ring, Gold Armlet, Jem Ring first and White Cape or Headband later. Placed in back row with Sadness.
  - Materia: Poison, HP Plus x2, Counter Attack, Enemy Skill, Lightning+Elemental, Gravity+Elemental.
  - Items are the primary healing source.
  - Gorky: Use Magic Hammer twice to prevent his magic attacks. The dive kicks remove a quarter health so using ???? can do a lot of damage. If the script goes right, Gorky should only get a Barrier off before both Magic Hammers, use Dive Kick up to twice, and try to do spells every other round. Once you use two Magic Hammers, simply spam ???? three times to win. Heal up after the fight and head upstairs.
  - Shake: Easy. Use L4 Suicide. Shake will probably die to a counter attack. Otherwise, just attack afterword to win. Heal and proceed.
  - Checkov: This fight is why we have Jem Ring on first. It might be tempting to use Magic Hammer to remove their MP, but the Jem Ring protects Yuffie from Stare Down and wastes their turns. Checkov will resort to Absorb only when MP runs out, so let them just spam Stare Down while you knock down their health with attacks. You could try to land poison too, but the chance seems low and physical attacks did more damage for me. Heal and proceed.
  - Staniv: Yeah, L4 Suicide and win again. Heal and proceed.
  - Godo: Make sure you have swapped to White Cape or Headband for this fight. Headband is preferable because it protects against Sleep, but if you don't have it, the protection against Mini is good too. Cast Big Guard first thing for the haste benefit, then use Bio2 to try to get a poison proc'd on Godo. Use your limit breaks as they come up, then spells/summons/enemy skills/attacks as you wish. Godo's second phase involves him casting Cure2 as a counter. Magic Hammer can be used to eventually remove that capability from him, while restoring your own MP. ???? can also be helpful as your HP gets lower.
The achievements will be unlocked upon the end of the cutscene after defeating Godo.

**Create Your Fantasy**: (Characters?) Defeating Godo yields the All Creation limit break item. Once Yuffie has all prior limit breaks learned, you can use it to learn the limit break and get this achievement.

**Battle Symphony**: (Challenge) While in Gold Saucer to get the Keystone, you might as well take care of this challenge. You can wait until after the Temple of the Ancients, I suppose, but the handicaps can end up throwing a wrench in your plans anyway so give it a shot! Use the save spot in Gold Saucer or outside North Corel to prepare. Equip Aerith with the Fairy Tale and strongest armor (I used Edincoat) plus any accessory that you feel works best. I opted to use the White Cape to mitigate any potential Frog or Mini status. Having Great Gospel can really help in a pinch, so make sure you have it by now. For materia, magic materia is probably not the best, other than Heal (hopefully with Esuna by this point), Time (for Haste), and maybe Restore. Using HP Plus and Counter Attack with Long Range are a good bunch of Independent materia. Enemy Skill is an absolute must. Of course, keep in mind that any of these materia can get disabled in the slot machine handicaps so it is in your best interest to also have a stock of items to support the damage output and healing. Be flexible and ready for anything as luck plays a HUGE part in this. If you are well stocked in items though, you can probably brute force through it. I opted to use Sadness to reduce damage further in my playthrough and still got a filled up limit gauge when I took a big hit that might have killed me if not for Sadness. However, you can also put yourself in a Fury state to ensure you get more limit breaks if you wish. The final battle can be easy if you know the weaknesses (Ghirofelgo dies with one Laser, Dragon and Ying/Yang can be hit with L4 Suicide, Zuu is trickier unless you have some sort of Wind elemental damage but some Betas can take care of it). There is a more detailed guide here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ff7/comments/9aqxpo/easily_getting_omnislash_early_using_aerith_in/.

**Battlehardened Perk**: (Treasure/Missable) When you leave the Battle Square after having won eight battles in a row (not for Dio's Keystone though), there will be a woman at the bottom of the stairs on the left. Talk to her before leaving for another part of the Gold Saucer to receive the Sprint Shoes accessory. If you miss this, she won't appear again and this achievement will be locked out. I thought at first that she was supposed to appear inside the Battle Square area, not out in the front, so I marked where she is standing in battle-square-fan.png.

**A Top Brawler**: (Challenge) When doing the Battle Square fight for the Keystone, much of the strategy for Aerith's **Battle Symphony** challenge achievement apply here, except for Cloud. In fact, I just moved all of my materia over to Cloud, forgot to put him in the back row, didn't put Sadness on him, and still won (though it got close with a Dragon finale). Again, adapt to the situations that are put in front of you with the slots (and make use of the slot exploit for more desirable outcomes, if you wish) and finish all eight fights to win the extra accessories from Dio and the achievement.

**A Fine Frenzy**: (Characters?) You could make your way through the Battle Square now to get the Omnislash limit break item at this point in the game, but it may be better to wait until after getting the Highwind as the BP requirement is greatly reduced and the battles will be much easier with better equipment and materia. I recommend holding off.

**Acoustic Fireworks (cont'd)**: If you were raising affinity with Barret, now is the moment! Once you have the Keystone and can't leave Gold Saucer, you'll go on a date with the highest affinity character. If it's Barret, you'll get this achievement.

**Hotel Momento/Coal and Gold Miner**: (Treasure) After getting/losing the Keystone and having to stay at the hotel, make sure to open the "mini-fridge" or whatever that is to get an Elixir and both of these achievements (**Coal and Gold Miner** if you got all the other items earlier).

**Tower Defense 101 (cont'd)**: It's time for the ninth battle! The guard in the shack gives the same strategy yet again. As before, there are even more enemy units, but funds should be plentiful by this point to support the fight if you've been continuing to work on expanding your party's limit breaks.
