This is not an official manual, walkthrough, or critical review. This document is a guide for the current achievement set (138 achievements as of _date to be updated_) available on [RetroAchievements](https://retroachievements.org/game/11258). This guide will give the player tips on earning the achievements, hash compatibility, and any other necessary or useful information. It may point to other resources for specific game walkthroughs that are not focused on the achievements themselves.

As with some of the other guides I've made, spoiler solutions for the boss strategies and a potential order to earning the achievements will be hidden in a collapsible entry that you must click to expand so that only the solutions you need assistance with will be viewable. Some of the more minor achievements will have strategies written outright without a collapsible dropdown so use the guide at your own risk.

## Potential Order

## Category Breakdowns

The category sections below contain each achievement in the section with tips or suggestions on how to unlock them. Not every achievement may warrant an in-depth discussion and the tips/suggestions I provide may not be the the most ideal. I'm open to feedback on how better to meet an achievement's requirements, as I have done with my previous guides. Feel free to [message me via RetroAchievements DM](https://retroachievements.org/messages/create?to=bdjeffyp) to discuss better strategies and I'll update them here with credit given.

Good luck in your achievement hunting!

### General advice

### Story/Progression

# My Notes During Playthrough

Here is where I have notes on each achievement as I progress that will help me make the final guide. Maybe I'll break up my notes by disc?

## General Notes and Potential Categories

- Story/Progression will always be a category.
- Endings is a likely candidate for its own category, along with spoiler filled discussion on how to obtain the ending.
- Boss Challenge, or just Challenge, is likely as well. There are quite a few boss challenges that are visible at a glance through the achievement list.
- Characters might be a good one. Not only are there achievements for recruiting each character, but also some specific achievements for aiding recruited characters (though perhaps these may be more Side Quest category worthy).
- Side Quest is a definite one

Consider making a section of the guide that discusses character recruitment and NG+/C+ mechanics to route when characters can join the party. Perhaps a breakdown a different possibilities people can take to accomplish things and get the achievements.

## Playthrough 1/Disc 1
- Intro/Dream:
    - **Chasing Phantoms in One's Dreams** (Story/Progression)
    - **Escape Your Nightmare** (Challenge/Missable): Missable because you can't fight enemies during this sequence. Does the achievement get locked out if you get into a battle, or are you able to run away? Yes, it is locked out as soon as battle is initiated! I managed to avoid all battles in my first attempt. Run behind the robots and run away if one begins to chase you (they are easy to get away from if they do begin to chase). If a bat begins to chase, get to another screen as they will hunt you down. The biggest issue is probably getting a favorable bat spawn that isn't blocking the path to the switch. I used the door down the stairs to reset the room when chased by the bat and then tried to get back to the switch room again. It took a couple of tries to get a bat that was flying away from the door to the switch room. Achievement pops at the same time as the related story/progression achievement, which is after the end of the FMV sequence that plays once you reach the door at the top of the fort.
- Arni Village (HW)->Opassa Beach (HW):
    - **Desperate Love** (Side Quest/Missable): Missable (don't know why?). Compliment the swordfish fisherman near the exit to the western side of the village (just to the left of Serge's house) and get a Komodo dragon scale, then give it to the boy on the east side of the same screen.
    - **Whaddaya Want Already!?** (Treasure): While in Home World Arni, go into the restaurant near the village entrance on the east side of town and "talk" to the barrel until it coughs up an item. The other part of this achievement will be while in Another World Arni.
    - **Pretty-Miracle-Power-X Master** (Characters/Missable): In the bedroom at the back of the restaurant, check the unmade bed to find the Heckran Bone. Find Poshul walking around the western side of town north of Chief Radius' battle lessons and give her the Heckran Bone.
    - **High Framerate #4** (Treasure): Find the Shellfish frame by checking the item seller's cart in the lower center area of town. Note that this is the fourth frame because you start with three of them: Arnian Wood, Simple Line, and Iron Plate.
    - **A Messenger of Love and Courage** (Characters): While in Home World Arni, speak to the fisherman in the basement of the northeastern house to get the Shark Tooth key item. You'll need this to get Mojo later.
    - **Delta Force** (Techs): When Leena discusses the past at Opassa Beach, respond "I remember" and "We'll never forget this day". This is needed to unlock Leena's level 7 tech which is then needed for the Delta Force triple tech.
    - **Nothing has Changed but Everything** (Story/Progression)
- Arni Village (AW)->Fossil Valley (AW):
    - **Whaddaya Want Already!?** (Treasure): Now that you are in Another World Arni, check the restaurant's "pot" where the "barrel" was until it coughs up it's item. Now this achievement will unlock.
    - **Mysterious Traveler** (Story/Progression): This is first obtainable in Another World Cape Howl after Kid helps you fight off Karsh and company. This is also the point where character recruitment first diverges. I had a save spot before this battle so that I could get this achievement but then I restarted so that I could have Leena instead for the first playthough. The achievement pops when you wake back up in Arni. Besides, resets for the Karsh battle may be a good idea if you are trying to get the Power Glove and/or Copper drops (or not resetting if one of them drops in your first attempt).
    - **Sweet Country Gal** (Characters/Missable): If you refused Kid's offer at Cape Howl, this pops when you wake up in Arni instead. Again, it's ideal to just get both achievements now by saving and fighting Karsh twice so that you can just get both achievements knocked out, but the choice is yours.
    - **A Messenger of Love and Courage** (Characters): As long as you got the Shark Tooth in Home World Arni, you can recruit Mojo after the events on Another World Cape Howl. Go back down to the basement of fisherman that gave you the Shark Tooth to find an altar with Mojo on it. Present the item to the fisherman and attempt to leave. Mojo will then join the party. Recruitment of Kid or Leena has no impact on this.
    - **Skeleton Clown** (Characters): The first part of Skelly, the Heavy Skull, is found in Another World Fossil Valley if you lie to the guard and tell them you are the party of exorcists. Once you've climbed up the ladder, head north past another guard to the giant dragon skull to find the Heavy Skull, who will hop out to join you automatically.
    - **Cute Baby Dragon** (Characters): Draggy's egg, the Big Egg item, is also past the guard in Another World Fossil Valley. As with Skelly, Draggy won't join now until you have the opportunity to hatch the egg later. You'll find the Big Egg with a Dodo down the bone ladder to the west of the blue tent. You can take the egg, which will aggro the Dodo, but then run away before you fight if you wish.
- Termina (AW)->Viper Manor (AW):
    - This is the big split between three different character recruitment paths. One possibility is to get the third character during the start of a third playthrough, sometimes called New Game++, but there is a possibility of using the Continue+ system as well to get all of the characters during the second playthrough.
    - My recommendation: Use the Continue+ process as it can actually make things faster and your characters more powerful.
    - Before entering Termina (or in the Inn's Record of Fate as soon as you enter town) and making your choice between Nikki, Guile, or Pierre, make two saves. Your primary save for the New Game playthrough will be in the first slot, but the backup save in the second slot will be the first point for Continue+.
        - A note about saving: The cursor when selecting where to save is quite sensitive. So take care when positioning which slot to save to.
    - For this guide, I will be taking Guile as the first character since the **King Moaman** boss challenge achievement must be done during a normal game, therefore Guile is required to get this achievement during the first playthrough.
    - **High Framerate #5** (Treasure): The "Tea for Three" frame is found at the northern end of the first screen of Termina, to the west of the General Viper statue. Just approach the building to the statue's left near the railing and a person will start talking to you about staying cool in the shade. Respond "Understood" to get the frame.
    - **The Path of the Rocker**, **Ze Path of ze Swordsman**, or **The Path of the Magician**: The road to unlocking one of these three mutually exclusive achievements starts here. After talking to Kid about infiltrating Viper Manor and her mentioning that you will need a guide, you will then be able to choose one of the three. These achievements are unlocked as soon as you enter Viper Manor with your selected character. If you went with Guile first, as recommended, **The Path of the Magician** will unlock after defeating King Moaman and the FMV showing Viper Manor (a nice callback to entering Magus' Castle in Chrono Trigger) finishes. Also, make sure to get the Hero's Medal from the kid running in circles outside the Smithy before selecting any character (you must be looking for a guide to get the medal).
    - **King Moaman** (Challenge/Missable): This must be done during a normal playthough (not NG+/C+) so Guile's path is required. There is no indicator to show that the achievement is primed so be careful to not mess up. If you do make a mistake, it should be possible to run away and try again since you probably haven't saved before this boss fight. The Red and Blue Moaman buff the King so the battle could be problematic, unless you did obtain the Profiteer's Purse and disassembled it for the iron and copper and built better weapons and armor (especially a Steel Swallow for Serge). Serge using up most of their stamina and then using Dash&Slash should take out most of King Moaman's HP. Have the other party members take out the remaining HP and take out the King quickly. Blue Moaman will probably cast Cure a couple of times if the King isn't downed quickly enough while Red buffs King and attacks the party. The achievement will unlock on the final strike of the last Moaman as long as the King was the first to be killed.
    - **Dragon Feeder** (Challenge): Do the dragon feeding minigame in Another World Viper Manor for the 10, 20, 30, and 40 feedings and obtain the rewards by winning the minigame. These shouldn't be too difficult, though the challenge does ramp up at 40 feedings. The true challenge are the next two achievements.
    - **Master Dragon Feeder** and **Overcooked** (Challenge/Missable): Must be done in the normal game so that you can't slow down time to cheese the minigame's challenge. The biggest challenge is how fast dragons want to be fed as your score increases. The forum chatter recommends using turbo settings to rapidly press the X (cross) button as you move Serge around as fast as possible and just hope that not too many dragons want food at the same time. This'll probably take a few tries! With practice and luck, you'll probably get it eventually, but be prepared to mash! Maybe keyboard will be helpful here? I used keyboard controls (arrows for left and right, Z for turbo'd X button that fired every frame) and was able to get **Master Dragon Feeder** on the first attempt and hit about 70 feedings before my first failed feeding, so very close to getting **Overcooked**! I got **Overcooked** on the second attempt. Using the keyboard was very helpful as I was able to mash the movement better with the arrow keys. I maintained three bundles as much as possible and stayed at the rightmost dragon and watching the others if they got hungry. Once I fed one or more dragons, I went right to the bin to grab more food and moved back to the far right. Once I hat about 50 points, I began to just cycle back and forth as fast as possible. I may have been lucky, but I managed to get to 80 points without a miss with this strategy.
