:no_entry: **\*\* NOTE: CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS FOR SOLVING ACHIEVEMENT PUZZLES \*\*** :no_entry:

This is not an official manual, walkthrough, or critical review. This document is a guide for the current achievement set (138 achievements as of _date to be updated_) available on [RetroAchievements](https://retroachievements.org/game/11258). This guide will give the player tips on earning the achievements, hash compatibility, and any other necessary or useful information. It may point to other resources for specific game walkthroughs that are not focused on the achievements themselves.

As with some of the other guides I've made, spoiler solutions for the boss strategies and a potential order to earning the achievements will be hidden in a collapsible entry that you must click to expand so that only the solutions you need assistance with will be viewable. Some of the more minor achievements will have strategies written outright without a collapsible dropdown so use the guide at your own risk.

## Potential Order

## Category Breakdowns

The category sections below contain each achievement in the section with tips or suggestions on how to unlock them. Not every achievement may warrant an in-depth discussion and the tips/suggestions I provide may not be the the most ideal. I'm open to feedback on how better to meet an achievement's requirements, as I have done with my previous guides. Feel free to [message me via RetroAchievements DM](https://retroachievements.org/messages/create?to=bdjeffyp) to discuss better strategies and I'll update them here with credit given.

Good luck in your achievement hunting!

### General advice

### Story/Progression

# My Notes During Playthrough

Here is where I have notes on each achievement as I progress that will help me make the final guide. Maybe I'll break up my notes by disc?

## General Notes and Potential Categories

- Story/Progression will always be a category.
- Endings is a likely candidate for its own category, along with spoiler filled discussion on how to obtain the ending.
- Boss Challenge, or just Challenge, is likely as well. There are quite a few boss challenges that are visible at a glance through the achievement list.
- Characters might be a good one. Not only are there achievements for recruiting each character, but also some specific achievements for aiding recruited characters (though perhaps these may be more Side Quest category worthy).
- Side Quest is a definite one

Consider making a section of the guide that discusses character recruitment and NG+/C+ mechanics to route when characters can join the party. Perhaps a breakdown a different possibilities people can take to accomplish things and get the achievements.

## Playthrough 1/Disc 1
- Intro/Dream:
    - **Chasing Phantoms in One's Dreams** (Story/Progression)
    - **Escape Your Nightmare** (Challenge/Missable): Missable because you can't fight enemies during this sequence. Does the achievement get locked out if you get into a battle, or are you able to run away? Yes, it is locked out as soon as battle is initiated! I managed to avoid all battles in my first attempt. Run behind the robots and run away if one begins to chase you (they are easy to get away from if they do begin to chase). If a bat begins to chase, get to another screen as they will hunt you down. The biggest issue is probably getting a favorable bat spawn that isn't blocking the path to the switch. I used the door down the stairs to reset the room when chased by the bat and then tried to get back to the switch room again. It took a couple of tries to get a bat that was flying away from the door to the switch room. Achievement pops at the same time as the related story/progression achievement, which is after the end of the FMV sequence that plays once you reach the door at the top of the fort.
- Arni Village (HW)->Opassa Beach (HW):
    - **Desperate Love** (Side Quest/Missable): Missable (don't know why?). Compliment the swordfish fisherman near the exit to the western side of the village (just to the left of Serge's house) and get a Komodo dragon scale, then give it to the boy on the east side of the same screen.
    - **Whaddaya Want Already!?** (Treasure): While in Home World Arni, go into the restaurant near the village entrance on the east side of town and "talk" to the barrel until it coughs up an item. The other part of this achievement will be while in Another World Arni.
    - **The Pursuit of Dreams** (Side Quest/Missable): Near the barrel in the Home World Arni Village restaurant is a waitress who writes poetry. Speak to her to hear a poem. This sets up accomplishing this achievemment later.
    - **Pretty-Miracle-Power-X Master** (Characters/Missable): In the bedroom at the back of the restaurant, check the unmade bed to find the Heckran Bone. Find Poshul walking around the western side of town north of Chief Radius' battle lessons and give her the Heckran Bone.
    - **High Framerate #4** (Treasure): Find the Shellfish frame by checking the item seller's cart in the lower center area of town. Note that this is the fourth frame because you start with three of them: Arnian Wood, Simple Line, and Iron Plate.
    - **A Messenger of Love and Courage** (Characters): While in Home World Arni, speak to the fisherman in the basement of the northeastern house to get the Shark Tooth key item. You'll need this to get Mojo later.
    - **Delta Force** (Techs): When Leena discusses the past at Opassa Beach, respond "I remember" and "We'll never forget this day". This is needed to unlock Leena's level 7 tech which is then needed for the Delta Force triple tech.
    - **Nothing has Changed but Everything** (Story/Progression)
- Arni Village (AW)->Fossil Valley (AW):
    - **Whaddaya Want Already!?** (Treasure): Now that you are in Another World Arni, check the restaurant's "pot" where the "barrel" was until it coughs up it's item. Now this achievement will unlock.
    - **The Pursuit of Dreams** (Side Quest/Missable): Near the pot in Another World Arni Village's restaurant is the waitress again, but she gave up on her dreams of being a poet. Talk to hear about it to continue the path toward this achievement.
    - **Mysterious Traveler** (Story/Progression): This is first obtainable in Another World Cape Howl after Kid helps you fight off Karsh and company. This is also the point where character recruitment first diverges. I had a save spot before this battle so that I could get this achievement but then I restarted so that I could have Leena instead for the first playthough. The achievement pops when you wake back up in Arni. Besides, resets for the Karsh battle may be a good idea if you are trying to get the Power Glove and/or Copper drops (or not resetting if one of them drops in your first attempt).
    - **Sweet Country Gal** (Characters/Missable): If you refused Kid's offer at Cape Howl, this pops when you wake up in Arni instead. Again, it's ideal to just get both achievements now by saving and fighting Karsh twice so that you can just get both achievements knocked out, but the choice is yours.
    - **A Messenger of Love and Courage** (Characters): As long as you got the Shark Tooth in Home World Arni, you can recruit Mojo after the events on Another World Cape Howl. Go back down to the basement of fisherman that gave you the Shark Tooth to find an altar with Mojo on it. Present the item to the fisherman and attempt to leave. Mojo will then join the party. Recruitment of Kid or Leena has no impact on this.
    - **Skeleton Clown #1** (Characters): The first part of Skelly, the Heavy Skull, is found in Another World Fossil Valley if you lie to the guard and tell them you are the party of exorcists. Once you've climbed up the ladder, head north past another guard to the giant dragon skull to find the Heavy Skull, who will hop out to join you automatically.
    - **Cute Baby Dragon** (Characters): Draggy's egg, the Big Egg item, is also past the guard in Another World Fossil Valley. As with Skelly, Draggy won't join now until you have the opportunity to hatch the egg later. You'll find the Big Egg with a Dodo down the bone ladder to the west of the blue tent. You can take the egg, which will aggro the Dodo, but then run away before you fight if you wish.
- Termina (AW)->Viper Manor (AW):
    - This is the big split between three different character recruitment paths. One possibility is to get the third character during the start of a third playthrough, sometimes called New Game++, but there is a possibility of using the Continue+ system as well to get all of the characters during the second playthrough.
    - My recommendation: Use the Continue+ process as it can actually make things faster and your characters more powerful.
    - Before entering Termina (or in the Inn's Record of Fate as soon as you enter town) and making your choice between Nikki, Guile, or Pierre, make two saves. Your primary save for the New Game playthrough will be in the first slot, but the backup save in the second slot will be the first point for Continue+.
        - A note about saving: The cursor when selecting where to save is quite sensitive. So take care when positioning which slot to save to.
    - For this guide, I will be taking Guile as the first character since the **King Moaman** boss challenge achievement must be done during a normal game, therefore Guile is required to get this achievement during the first playthrough.
    - **High Framerate #5** (Treasure): The "Tea for Three" frame is found at the northern end of the first screen of Termina, to the west of the General Viper statue. Just approach the building to the statue's left near the railing and a person will start talking to you about staying cool in the shade. Respond "Understood" to get the frame.
    - **The Path of the Rocker**, **Ze Path of ze Swordsman**, or **The Path of the Magician**: The road to unlocking one of these three mutually exclusive achievements starts here. After talking to Kid about infiltrating Viper Manor and her mentioning that you will need a guide, you will then be able to choose one of the three. These achievements are unlocked as soon as you enter Viper Manor with your selected character. If you went with Guile first, as recommended, **The Path of the Magician** will unlock after defeating King Moaman and the FMV showing Viper Manor (a nice callback to entering Magus' Castle in Chrono Trigger) finishes. Also, make sure to get the Hero's Medal from the kid running in circles outside the Smithy before selecting any character (you must be looking for a guide to get the medal).
    - **King Moaman** (Challenge/Missable): This must be done during a normal playthough (not NG+/C+) so Guile's path is required. There is no indicator to show that the achievement is primed so be careful to not mess up. If you do make a mistake, it should be possible to run away and try again since you probably haven't saved before this boss fight. The Red and Blue Moaman buff the King so the battle could be problematic, unless you did obtain the Profiteer's Purse and disassembled it for the iron and copper and built better weapons and armor (especially a Steel Swallow for Serge). Serge using up most of their stamina and then using Dash&Slash should take out most of King Moaman's HP. Have the other party members take out the remaining HP and take out the King quickly. Blue Moaman will probably cast Cure a couple of times if the King isn't downed quickly enough while Red buffs King and attacks the party. The achievement will unlock on the final strike of the last Moaman as long as the King was the first to be killed.
    - **Dragon Feeder** (Challenge): Do the dragon feeding minigame in Another World Viper Manor for the 10, 20, 30, and 40 feedings and obtain the rewards by winning the minigame. These shouldn't be too difficult, though the challenge does ramp up at 40 feedings. The true challenge are the next two achievements.
    - **Master Dragon Feeder** and **Overcooked** (Challenge/Missable): Must be done in the normal game so that you can't slow down time to cheese the minigame's challenge. The biggest challenge is how fast dragons want to be fed as your score increases. The forum chatter recommends using turbo settings to rapidly press the X (cross) button as you move Serge around as fast as possible and just hope that not too many dragons want food at the same time. This'll probably take a few tries! With practice and luck, you'll probably get it eventually, but be prepared to mash! Maybe keyboard will be helpful here? I used keyboard controls (arrows for left and right, Z for turbo'd X button that fired every frame) and was able to get **Master Dragon Feeder** on the first attempt and hit about 70 feedings before my first failed feeding, so very close to getting **Overcooked**! I got **Overcooked** on the second attempt. Using the keyboard was very helpful as I was able to mash the movement better with the arrow keys. I maintained three bundles as much as possible and stayed at the rightmost dragon and watching the others if they got hungry. Once I fed one or more dragons, I went right to the bin to grab more food and moved back to the far right. Once I hat about 50 points, I began to just cycle back and forth as fast as possible. I may have been lucky, but I managed to get to 80 points without a miss with this strategy.
    - **The Gambler** (Side Quest/Missable): During Guile's path through Another World Viper Manor, fall down into the basement and head down the left hallway and into one of the first two doors into the dining area. Pick up the Dragoon's Honor item in the chest in the northeast corner. This will be needed to show the fortune teller in Another World Termina and get this achievement later.
    - **A Guinea Pig Experiment** and **A Scientific Genius** (Characters/Missable): In Another World Viper Manor's basement, down the right hallway, enter the vault and take the silver pendant on the wall that is an obvious trap. Defeat Luccia's Neo-N Bulbs for a star level. Then, unlock Pip's cage and talk to Luccia to set up recruitment of these two later in the game.
    - **The Chrono Trigger** (Story/Progression): Pops at the end of events at Another World Viper Manor.
- Guldove (AW)->Hermit's Hideaway(AW):
    - When the menu appears after completing Viper Manor, it's time for making the third save slot to return to with Continue+ after finishing the first playthrough. So, make a save on slots one and three and keep your main save on slot one as you progress. Of course, making backup saves beyond is fine as well, just make sure you know where your major decision point save slots are at for when you Continue+ during playthough two.
    - As for "The Choice" of helping or leaving Kid, this walkthrough will opt to leave Kid by choosing "...I don't know" and "...There's nothing we can do", so we will get Doc, Macha (**Gutsy Mother of Two**), and Glenn (**The Noble Knight**). This will eventually lead to the **You Just Have to Have Faith** achievement. The saving Kid path will be done during playthrough two. Also note that we can't steal the Moonglasses from Harle for the **I Lost my Glasses but I Need my Glasses to Find my Glasses** achievement in this playthrough. Again, this is another good reason to chart out what achievements will be obtainable by playthrough choices for the roadmap.
    - **Skeleton Clown #2** (Characters): The second part of Skelly, the Pelvic Bone, is found in Another World Guldove. Speak with the element trader just outside of the hospital after making The Choice about Kid and ask to trade. After leaving the trade menu, the trader will ask you to take the bone. Say "Ok, I'll do it" and you'll have the Pelvic Bone.
    - **High Framerate #6** (Treasure): Macha gives the Tropical Paradise frame to you after your conversation with her and Korcha.
    - **The Noble Knight** (Characters): Head to the Another World Termina town entrance after arriving from Guldove to see a scene with Glenn. Return to Macha to get the boat and then Glenn will approach. Accept his request to join to unlock the achievement and get arguably one of the best characters in the game.
    - **X-Strike** (Combo Techs): Once Glenn is recruited, you should already have the ability to do an X-Strike with Serge and Glenn's element level 3 techs. Charge them both up to that level and then one of them select the X-Strike element to unlock the achievement.
    - **Gutsy Mother of Two** (Characters): Right after recruiting Glenn, Macha will ask to join as well. Accept and get the achievement.
    - **The Gambler** (Side Quest): Have Guile in the party and speak to the fortune teller again. He'll show her the Dragoon's Honor and receive a brass rod (and this achievement) as the reward.
    - **Psychic Ex-Wrestler** (Characters): Go the the shrines area in Another World Termina to see a scene where Greco is attending to the funeral of a couple's child. After the service, he approaches the party then returns to his home. Follow him in and speak to him and allow him to join the party.
    - Time to check out some of the past areas as well as places we didn't go when we picked Guile as our guide:
    - **High Framerate #7** (Treasure): Go to Another World Viper Manor and enter a secret doorway behind the desk of the library. Speak with the "Nu" near what appears to be Epoch mid-construction to receive the Porre's Furnace frame.
    - **Rebaptism** (Side Quest/Missable): After getting the frame from the "Nu", it offers to change your name. Accept and make a different name to get this achievement. Don't worry. You can change it back. I'm not aware of why this is missable...
    - **A Scientific Genius** (Characters/Missable): Speak with Luccia at the rooftop terrace where Kid was poisoned earlier in Another World Viper Manor, then speak to her again in her basement lab and allow her to join. This is missable because we need to have unlocked Pip's cage during the infiltration of Viper Manor earlier.
    - **Skeleton Clown #3** (Characters): The third part of Skelly, the Angry Scapula, is found in Another World Shadow Forest. Enter a cave behind a waterfall near the Quadffid to find a notebook with details about fighting the boss and also a bone different from the others. Take the bone to add it to your Skelly collection.
    - **High Framerate #8** (Treasure) and **The Peacekeepers** (Challenge or maybe "Puzzle"?): Grab the Aroma Pouch from the chest next to Skelly's Angry Scapula, then check the topmost green bush in the screen with the Quadffid. This will attract a red scent. Go back to the first screen of Another World Shadow Forest and check the red monster to get it to follow you. Escort the red monster back to Quadffid to have the boss eat it. Now talk to Quadffid and it shrinks before you can fight it. It gives you the Skullduggery frame and runs away, netting you **The Peacekeepers** achievement.
    - **Skeleton Clown #4** (Characters): The fourth part of Skelly, the Good Backbone, is found in Another World Hydra Marshes. It is in an pathway where you are obscured and you notice something on the ground when you walk in. Grab it and this part is yours. The pathway is just north of a chest containing a Tablet element.
    - **Miracle of Life** (Characters): Get the Life Sparkle from Another World Hydra Marshes. Return to Another World Viper Manor's rooftop terrace and use it on the blossom to get NeoFio and the achievement.
    - **Skeleton Clown #5** (Characters): The fifth part of Skelly, the Sturdy Ribs, is found in Another World Water Dragon Isle. Speak to the researcher on the center path heading north who will kindly hand it over to you.
    - **Skeleton Clown #6** (Characters): The sixth part(s) of Skelly, the Mixed Bones, is found in Another World Isle of the Damned. Just head to the back of the island on the first screen and enter a dark cave and check the area to receive them. This completes all of the parts. Skelly puts themselves back together and then leaves. Return to Another World Termina and speak to Skelly's grandmother, leave their house, then re-enter and speak to Skelly to recruit them and get the achievement.
- S.S. Invincible (AW)->Water Dragon Isle (HW):
    - **A Guinea Pig Experiment** (Characters/Missable): Pip will be on S.S. Invincible in a cargo hold where Dead Beats run around in set patterns, Wraiths chase you as you run after Pip, and a couple of chests are available to plunder. Pip hides in three areas as you try to talk to them. Chase them around the hold until in gets into the southwest corner and have them join to get the achievement. Make sure to get Pip before heading past the save point that is near the ladder to the boss fight against Dead Head!
    - **A Mariner's Worst Nightmare** (Story/Progression): Simply win the fight against Dead Head.
    - **You Just Have to Have Faith** (Story/Missable): Since we left Kid because it seemed impossible to help her, going back to check on her in Another World Guldove after leaving S.S. Invincible will eventually lead to unlocking this achievement. It is missable, I assume, because it only unlocks if you left Kid rather than try to save her. You also now have Doc and Kid in your party.
    - **A Hole that Connect Here and There** (Story/Progression): Now that we finally have the Astral Amulet, you can cross dimensions. When you do that for the first time, this achievement unlocks.
    - **The Paradox** (Side Quest/Missable): Return to Home World Arni Village and speak with Leena with Another World Leena in the party. I'm not sure why this is missable so make sure you do this as soon as you have the Astral Amulet and before heading to the Water Dragon Isle or heading to Mt. Pyre/Fort Dragonia. It can't be missable based on the choice of leaving or saving Kid...
    - **The Pursuit of Dreams** (Side Quest/Missable): Back in Home World Arni Village's restaurant, speak to the waitress near the barrel to tell her about her Another World version. You'll receive the Book of Poems. Head back to Another World Arni Village and show the book to the waitress to get a Rainbow Shell and unlock this achievement.
    - **Hasta la Beeba Baby** (Challenge/Missable): In Home World Hydra Marshes, there are two battles with a monster known as Beeba. The first one, known as BubbaBeeba is in the screen following the chest that has a Brace element. After about four attacks in battle (in the two attempts I made to get this achievement), BubbaBeeba, or Beeba A on the battle screen, will call for help. So, you have about 8 attacks before this achievement fails. Note that there is no indicator for this achievement so if call for help is used twice or more, make sure you don't save and reset to try again. There are a couple of strategies you could use here. You can wait to come here until later in the game when your party would be overpowered. If you are like me and want to get the achievement sooner, you can try to damage BubbaBeeba enough before 8 turns. Some strategies suggest using TurnBlack on level 1 with a non-Serge character (2 turns down) and then attack with Serge and use Dash&Slash. What I did was put HellSoul on everyone, do two attacks, then attempt to HellSoul BubbaBeeba, which takes three rounds giving you two attempts. HellSoul has a 25% chance of instant killing the enemy. I managed to land it on my fourth try over the course of two runs through the fight. I then finished off the one other Beeba that was summoned and the achievement unlocked on the final hit. **NOTE**: There is another Beeba after the save point guarding a treasure chest. I recommend saving this encounter for later for getting Sprigg's Dopplegang from it so you don't have to get it with Continue+ later. The choice is yours however.
    - **Winged Centipede** (Challenge/Missable): In Home World Hydra Marshes, after defeating BubbaBeeba and getting the Beeba Flute, find Potpourri enemies to poison your party members. Once all three characters are poisoned, head back to the save point and save, then continue down the path to the open space to summon the Wingapede. Use some Tablets ahead of time to heal back up to full HP before using the flute. Now defeat the boss! It's green innate so yellow elements should do a lot of damage quickly or, if you came here later with more star levels, you should knock it down quickly with regular attacks. I also like to buff Serge with Strength and Eagle Eye from the other party members to do a ton of damage with Dash&Slash. This is what I did, along with a fast followup from Glenn using ElectroBolt to finish the boss. Achievement will pop on the last hit. **NOTE**: Either reset to the last save and refight Wingapede while not poisoned to conserve resources, or return to the save point and heal back up **BEFORE** stepping on the cracked surface. Another boss fight challenge is following shortly after and you will need to prepare.
    - **Madam Pentapus** (Challenge/Missable): Can't be done on the Leave Kid path??? But this must be done on a normal playthrough only? Hmmm... That's troubling. I confirmed in the achievement code that Continue+ is not eligible because it checks for the Time Shifter. So, in order to actually do this, I'll need to pick up from the Save/Leave Kid choice save on slot 3 and play through Home World Hydra Marshes to get Razzly and fight this boss without using Continue+. Once I have beat the boss, I can press on with Continue+ again. This definitely puts a wrinkle in the routing for getting all of the achievements. It does look like this one achievement is the only one that is mutually exclusive to the Save Kid path while needing to be on Normal game, so I think the idea of picking up Playthrough Two with a normal Continue until this achievement is unlocked, then switching to Continue+ is the right call.
    - **Hi-Ho** (Challenge/Missable): Make sure that you don't use multi-target elements and confirm that your attacks are targeting Hi-Ho Tank only. The challenge of this fight is that the support Dwarves will repair the tank as it hits critical HP. Repair, a white element move, heals around 110-120HP depending on the field so make sure you are out damaging the healing. Additionally, having a green innate character with green attack elements will be helpful as well as boosting Serge with Strength. Hi-Ho Tank did hit Serge with a black ElementShot, taking off half of his HP AND inflicting Darkness, so I was more reliant on Glenn to do the damage needed while Serge healed the party with RecoverAll. Not too bad of a challenge though as long as you are mindful of your targeting. **NOTE**: No matter how fast you get through Water Dragon Isle, while on this Leave Kid route, it is not possible to get the Wisp Cape and the **Fairy Savior** achievement. Rosetta will live but the fairies will blame the party and all humans for the crisis that occurred.
- Mt. Pyre (AW)->Fort Dragonia (AW):
    - **Red Hot Chili Peppor** (Challenge/Missable): After Solt and Peppor teach you about how trap elements work, get to work reducing the hit points of both enemies. Focus on one of them first until they get to critical HP range (they both slump over when nearly defeated). I focused on Solt (the tall one) first. Then, I targeted Peppor. If both of them get down to critical HP, just defend and heal as needed. Eventually, they will target each other. Once one has been knocked down by the other, take out the remaining enemy and the achievement will pop on the last hit.
    - **Firewalkers** (Treasure/Missable): There are six treasure chests in Mt. Pyre and three boss fights before the exit. You have to get all of the chests and complete all boss fights while not using the Ice Breath from the Water Dragon when navigating the cave. One strategy to keep your health up is to get into fights, build up enough element level where a character has RecoverAll equipped, and then run away to heal in the post battle menu. There is a save point before the last two bosses in the area but I didn't use it in the event that this achievement required one session. If you have any party members die and miss out on the star level bonuses from the final two boss fights, I would wait until after getting the achievement before resetting and trying the battles again. The achievement unlocks after the Dragoons boss fight and you answer Harle's question to continue on your quest.
