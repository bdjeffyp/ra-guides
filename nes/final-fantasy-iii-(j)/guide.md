# Final Fantasy III (J)

Guide written by [bdjeffyp](https://retroachievements.org/User/bdjeffyp)

## Version History

- v2.0.0 (*date to be determined*): A lot of changes occurred thanks to a set revision! The revision removed some arduous achievements, added new boss challenge achievements, and added regional treasure collection benchmark achievements to make getting [No Stone Unturned](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/43079) a bit easier (or knowing what caused you to miss it). Here is a breakdown of the guide changes:
    - *Note the changes here as I go...*
    - General grammar fixes
    - Update the About section with better formatting and a bit about why I went with the Chaos Rush localization and updated the link
    - Updated the Supported Game Files link
    - Changed the achievement categories
    - Added the Potential Order section
- v1.1.0 (4/2/2024): Moved box art, spoiler discussion, and naming convention details into the About section. Found and fixed minor spelling errors. Updated the header sectioning to be more consistent, using a level two header for the category breakdowns then making the categories themselves a level three header.
- v1.0.2 (9/23/2023): Updated Compatibility section and specified dates of relevancy for when I state "currently" in the guide.
- v1.0.1 (9/4/2021): Formatting cleanup (thanks to FluffyEmmy for that!)
- v1.0.0 (12/24/2020): Initial release

## About

:no_entry: **\*\* MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS \*\*** :no_entry:

This is not an official manual, walkthrough, or critical review. This document is a simple guide for the current achievement set available on [RetroAchievements](https://retroachievements.org/game/5553). This guide will give the player tips on earning the achievements, hash compatibility, and any other necessary or useful information.

Note that the names of characters, places, etc. used in this guide are based off of the [Chaos Rush localization](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAPatches/blob/main/NES/Translation/English/5553-FF3-English.zip), which is closest to the official Square Enix localization for Final Fantasy III on the Nintendo DS and the Pixel Remaster. Since the achievement descriptions seem to use the early localization effort's names, I figure that using the Chaos Rush localization here can help those who prefer using the more modern naming conventions know how they relate to the achievements with the older names.

When possible, I will try to use both names with the Chaos Rush name first followed by the early localization in parentheses.
<br>
It will appear like this, as an example:
<br>Gysahl(Gisahl)

## Introduction	

Final Fantasy III is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the Family Computer. Released in Japan in 1990, it was the third installment in the Final Fantasy series. It is the first numbered Final Fantasy game to feature the job-change system. The story revolves around four orphaned youths drawn to a crystal of light. The crystal grants them some of its power, and instructs them to go forth and restore balance to the world. Not knowing what to make of the crystal's pronouncements, but nonetheless recognizing the importance of its words, the four inform their adoptive families of their mission and set out to explore and bring back the balance.

This game further establishes many of the Final Fantasy series norms that were set in Final Fantasy II, such as chocobos, expanded character classes, and familiar spells, while also bringing back the experience point system of the first game. Additionally, certain features of Final Fantasy IV, such as Fat Chocobo and summon spells, started in this game.

## Trivia

- Final Fantasy III was first officially released outside of Japan with the Nintendo DS 3D remake in 2006. The Famicom version was released on Wii and Wii U Virtual Consoles, but only in Japan. Therefore, the Famicom version with translation hacks is the only way to play the original game. A 2D remake was finally made available worldwide with the Pixel Remaster releases of the first six Final Fantasy games.
- A 2D remake was initially in the works for the WonderSwan Color. However, due to cartridge storage sizes for the system and programming complications, Square was only able to produce remakes for Final Fantasy I and II for the system.
- The game earned the third highest score in _Famitsu_ the year of its release, scoring a 36 out of 40, which was one point less than F-Zero and Dragon Quest IV.
- The overworld theme, Eternal Wind, has appeared in several other Final Fantasy games, such as during the opening movie of the Shadowbringers expansion of Final Fantasy XIV and a bard in the Dead Dunes town of Ruffian sings a version with lyrics in Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII.

## Save Support

The game uses a battery to save game data across three slots. Players can save the game at any time while on the overworld map to any one of the three slots.

There are a couple of spots in the game where it is to your advantage to make use of the multiple save slots, especially before Saronia(Salonia). Make a save before flying over Saronia(Salonia) so that if your party is not prepared, you can explore other parts of the world before you are stuck there.

## Compatibility

Currently (as of 9/23/2023) this game has 10 unique ROM(s) registered for it. View the latest [Supported Game Files](https://retroachievements.org/game/5553/hashes) page to ensure that you have a valid game for your achievements.

I used the Final Fantasy III (Japan) (En) (v1.3) (Chaos Rush) version when making this guide and earning my mastery.

## Leaderboards

There are no leaderboards currently associated with the game.

## Achievement Categories

There are a total of 90 achievements (as of *date to be determined*), which can be broken down into the following categories:
- **[Story/Progression](#storyprogression)**: 27 achievements earned naturally through the course of gameplay (there are a couple that are considered progression but not marked as such in the set)
- **[Side Quest](#side-quest)**: 20 achievements earned by going to out-of-the-way locations and talking to various NPCs
- **[Treasure](#treasure)**: 19 achievements, **5 of which are missable**, that unlock as all chests in a region are opened, with a final achievement for opening all of them.
- **[Challenge](#challenge)**: 16 achievements, **15 of which are missable**, that require specific actions and party configuration for specific boss fights and dungeons.
- **[Post-Game](#post-game)**: 8 achievements that are ideal to get after completing the game. Note that there is no post-game save. Going for these achievements are such a grind that can adversely impact your enjoyment of the final dungeon so I recommend completing the game first before doing these.

Out of all of the achievements, a total of **20 are missable**.

## Potential Order

The following is a breakdown of the order of achievements based on my personal playthrough. Note that this is only a potential order for you to follow and not a strict timing on when achievements should be unlocked, especially when grind achievements are considered.

Each section is grouped under story achievements and hidden under a dropdown to avoid spoilers. If you want to see the achievements, **click on the arrow** next to each section to reveal the table. The dropdown names have the number of achievements in the section so that you can see at a glance about how many achievements you should have by the end of a section, if you were to follow my guide to the letter.

:no_entry: **MINOR SPOILER SECTION** :no_entry:
<br>The tables only reveal when achievements can be earned and possibly missed. No strategies on earning the achievements are provided here, just the approximate order I earned them in.

## Category Breakdowns

The category sections below contain each achievement in the section with tips or suggestions on how to unlock them. Not every achievement may warrant an in-depth discussion and the tips/suggestions I provide may not be the the most ideal. I'm open to feedback on how better to meet an achievement's requirements, as I have done with my previous guides. Feel free to [message me via RetroAchievements DM](https://retroachievements.org/messages/create?to=bdjeffyp) to discuss better strategies and I'll update them here with credit given.

Good luck in your achievement hunting!

- **TODO:** Remove the descriptions for each achievement. Ensure that the description text is covered in the tips cells, because it does seem that I referenced the description text quite a bit. Note that the descriptions have been updated by the recent revision, so that is why I need to remove them.
- **TODO:** Ensure the titles are matching what is currently shown. They may have been updated in the revision.

### Story/Progression

No discussion on the story achievements here as you simply need to play through the game to earn them. You can't miss them!

### Side Quest

| Title and Description | Tips |
|---|---|
| ![Old man NPC sprite](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/43986.png)<br>[Painkiller](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/42881) <br>`Share a Potion with a citizen in need` | Considered a side quest as you aren't required to speak to this old man in the village of Ur at the beginning of the game. If you talk to all NPCs though, you shouldn't have a problem with getting this and the remaining side quest achievements. |
| ![Chocobo sprite](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44028.png)<br>[Breadwinner](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/42895) <br>`Claim your prize for riding a chocobo around the continent` | You can meet the requirements for the side quest immediately upon finding your first chocobo in the Chocobo Forest outside of the Village of the Ancients(Ancients' Village). Simply run around the outside ring of the continent and then enter the Village and speak to a child in town to get your prize and the achievement. You don't even have to talk to the kid before hand. |
| ![Sheep sprite](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44126.png)<br>[The Grass is Greener Here](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43017) <br>`Find the farming town of Gysahl(Gisahl)` | After saving the Floating Continent from falling, you can sail to this town. You aren't required to come here, but you may want to if you don't want to use a Thief during your game. |
| ![Fat Chocobo sprite](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44127.png)<br>[You're Gonna Carry That Weight](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43019) <br>`Meet the Fat Chocobo` | Use a Gysahl Green(Carrot) at a spot that smells like chocobos to make the Fat Chocobo appear. While this is optional, you will probably unlock this as a result of managing your items during the course of the game. |
| ![Back side of white mage facing a desk](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44133.png)<br>[Is This Safe to Drink...?](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43029) <br>`Receive a gift from a reclusive chemist` | After saving the Elder(Eldest) Tree, don't forget to go back to Castle Argus(Argass) to the locked room on the top-left side of the castle's rampart. A white mage will be there to give you a gift. |
| ![Evoker sprite](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44142.png)<br>[Welcome to Summoning 101](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43038)<br>`Find the village of Replito(Leprit)` | As soon as the Enterprise is freed from it's chain, you can visit this town. Be wary of flying near the castle of Saronia(Salonia), however, or you will have to remember to find one or both of these towns after that storyline is concluded. |
| ![Bard sprite](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44141.png)<br>[The Musical Kingdom](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43039)<br>`Find the village of Duster(Dastar)` | As soon as the Enterprise is freed from it's chain, you can visit this town. Be wary of flying near the castle of Saronia(Salonia), however, or you will have to remember to find one or both of these towns after that storyline is concluded. |
| ![Dragoon sprite](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44143.png)<br>[We're Gonna Have to Jump](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43040)<br>`Ransack the Dragon Spire(Tower)` | While you don't have to do this as part of the story, it'll definitely make your battles in Saronia(Salonia) that much easier with all the loot you get here. You'll find the Dragon Spire in the southeastern section of the city. |
| ![Black mage sprite](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44149.png)<br>[In Case You Missed Anything](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43044)<br>`Find Doga(Dorga)'s Village` | This achievement can be accomplished as soon as you get the ability to submerge the Nautilus. The village is a great place to fill out needed spells you haven't purchased earlier in your journey. |
| ![Four treasure chest sprites laid out 2 by 2](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44156.png)<br>[Sunken Treasure](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43047)<br>`Loot the hidden chests in the Undersea Cave` | This achievement can be accomplished as soon as you get the ability to submerge the Nautilus. The hidden treasures will go toward the [No Stone Unturned](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43079) challenge achievement but these four are significant for the unique battles contained within. |
| ![Shinobi monster sprite](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44158.png)<br>[The Power of the Dark Side](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43049) <br>`Find all the Magic Knight equipment laying around Falgabard(Fargabaad)` | You can go to this town after getting the Invincible. Going through the cave in the back of town will be a great chance to prepare for the [Divided They Fall](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43054) challenge! |
| ![Odin monster sprite](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44150.png)<br>[The Allfather](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43045) <br>`Prove yourself worthy of summoning Odin` | You can attempt to battle Odin once you have a submergible Nautilus. Sail to the Saronia(Salonia) Catacombs underwater just south of the city. |
| ![Leviathan monster sprite](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44159.png)<br>[The Sea Serpent](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43050) <br>`Prove yourself worthy of summoning Leviathan` | You can attempt to battle Leviathan within Lake Dor on the Floating Continent once you have the Invincible. Cross the mountain with the airship, get out, and enter the lake in your canoe to reach the pacing shadow. |
| ![Bahamut monster sprite](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44162.png)<br>[The King of Dragons](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43051) <br>`Prove yourself worthy of summoning Bahamut` | You can attempt to battle Bahamut once you have the Invincible. It's cave is an excellent spot to grind levels in preparation for doing the [Oops, Forgot My Sunscreen](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43052) challenge. |
| ![A treasure chest surrounded by walls](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44168.png)<br>[I am Protected](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43058)<br>`Obtain the Ribbon from Forbidden Land Eureka` | The only Ribbon you can find before the point of no return! You'll want to find it for the [No Stone Unturned](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43079) challenge. As you explore the second floor, look for a wall you can walk through. Be ready to fight for the item! |
| ![A circular bladed weapon](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44171.png)<br>[Keep Away from Werewolves](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43059)<br>`Obtain the Full Moon` | You'll naturally come across this weapon during your Eureka descent. The Moonring(Full Moon) is defended, but is necessary for the [No Stone Unturned](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43079) challenge. |
| ![A katana](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44170.png)<br>[A True Samurai](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43060)<br>`Obtain the Masamune` | Another weapon out in the open as you dive Eureka. As with the others, this weapon is defended by another monster. |
| ![A sword in stone](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44172.png)<br>[The Holy Sword](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43061)<br>`Obtain Excalibur` | Yet another weapon out in the open as you descend further into Eureka. Also defended by a monster. |
| ![A sword among skulls](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44174.png)<br>[Post-Apocalyptic](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43062)<br>`Obtain Ragnarok` | Yes. Another weapon waiting for you to grab it. It's also in Eureka. It's also guarded by a beast most foul. |
| ![A staff with a ninja and sage on either side](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44173.png)<br>[Employees of the Month](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43063)<br>`Receive the Ninja and Sage jobs. Oh, and a staff, too` | Lying opposite from Ragnarok. This weapon comes with two jobs as well! |
| ![A close-up sprite of a shuriken](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44176.png)<br>[Need Some Ammo?](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43067)<br>`Find the hidden passage at the bottom of Eureka` | Reaching the bottom, you find two sages with the level 8 spells and Odin, Leviathan, and Bahamut summons. A hidden switch can be found on the wall behind them by walking up between the two. |
| ![Xande clone monster sprite](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44183.png)<br>[Attack of the Clones](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43073)<br>`Obtain all four Ribbons from the Dark World` | After passing the point of no return, you'll find one treasure chest on each path to a Dark Crystal that contains a Ribbon. Don't worry: they are also guarded! |

### Treasure

### Challenge

All of these achievements are **MISSABLE** because almost all of them are tied to completing a dungeon, including a one-time boss battle, under specific conditions! Prior to attempting, I _highly recommend_ saving prior to attempting. If the achievement doesn't pop upon completing the boss fight, reset and try again. You should be safe if you set up the party's Jobs prior to entering the dungeon associated with the challenge.
<br>Make sure you have at least **ONE MAGIC KEY** from Gysahl(Gisahl) prior to leaving the Floating Continent for the first time (or get **four** to be safe)!

| Title and Description | Tips |
|---|----|
| ![Crying Onion Knight sprite](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/43967.png)<br>[We Fear Change](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/42880)<br>`Conquer the Sealed Cave(Cave of the Seal) with a party full of Onion Knights(Kids)` | The first of the Job Class challenges! <br>Before entering the Sealed Cave(Cave of the Seal), ensure your party is turned back into Onion Knights before entering, if you ever changed into another job prior to that point. The achievement will be completed if you defeat the Djinn(Jinn) without changing jobs. In my playthrough, I used other jobs so I made sure to change my party back to Onion Knights before entering the cave. <br>Overall, the challenge isn't too difficult to complete with Onion Knights if you have been persistent in fighting and gaining levels. The Onion Knight job skill level should be inconsequential to success but it can't hurt to grind some job levels if you are concerned. |
| ![Dead Warrior sprite](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44000.png)<br>[Why Are You Even Here?!](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/42889)<br>`Conquer the Nepto Temple(Shrine of Nepto) with a non-caster in the lead spot` | This challenge is interesting since your entire party is Mini and physical attacks are severely reduced. You must have your first character as a Warrior(Fighter) or other non-magic using class. Ensure your party is set up prior to entering the temple from the world map! Changing it while in the temple but before going Mini and into the statue will not work! <br>Put all four characters in the back row so that your Warrior can participate by drawing attacks away from your casters without dying outright. |
| !["No" symbol over Scholar sprite](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44131.png)<br>[Illiterate Warriors](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43027)<br>`Conquer Castle Hein(Hyne) without a Scholar in the party` | Before getting captured in Tokkul(Tokkle), make sure you don't have a Scholar in your party. <br>Honestly, this isn't that bad. If you have been persistent in leveling up your White and Black Mages, your spell damage with Aero and Poison should be enough to override Hein's barrier. Another strategy is to test your Fire/Blizzard/Thunder spells to see which is functional. Once you find the right one, if you are quick, you can keep casting the spell before Hein shifts the barrier. |
| !["No" symbol over Thief sprite](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44139.png)<br>[The Honest Approach](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43037)<br>`Conquer Goldor Manor(Goldor's Mansion) without a Thief in the party` | Before entering Goldor Manor, you must not have a Thief in your party. To complete the dungeon, then, you must have at least one **magic key**! If you only have one key, be sure to only open the door to the top-right room of the first floor of the Manor to progress. The three other locked doors don't have anything anyway but if you use your only key on one of them, you are stuck. <br>Since Gysahl(Gisahl) is the only place you can buy magic keys and you are landlocked at this point in the game, it behooves you to make sure that you have at least one magic key prior to entering the Cave of Tides(Water Cave). |
| !["No symbol over Magic Knight sprite](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44163.png)<br>[Divided They Fall](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43054)<br>`Conquer the Cave of Shadows(Darkness) without a Magic Knight in the party` | This is the challenge achievement that took me the longest to complete. The Cave of Shadows(Darkness) is 11(!) floors of pain, due to the dividing enemies that will split with any physical attack. Since Magic Knights are prohibited, using magic/summons are a good alternative. If you don't have characters with magic or summons built up, I suggest grinding to build up the job skills and levels for your characters. Since the Evoker(Conjurer) is unpredictable, I recommend sticking with a White Mage for healing/Aero/Confuse and a Black Mage for dealing damage. The ideal location for grinding is in the first floor of the Cave of Bahamut as the monsters there are low risk with a lot of experience points. Raising levels will increase your cast count for each spell level. It is okay to keep physical combatants as well for taking damage and providing killing blows that won't cause splitting. I used the Knight and Black Belt(Karateka), but you can change it up based on your primary role for these characters. <br>Once you feel ready, begin your descent into the Cave of Shadows! I recommend taking this over multiple dives, gathering items from a floor, climbing back out, recovering in the Invincible, and saving your game once you clear a floor. This will allow you to determine your capabilities to go further and make subsequent dives in previously cleared floors quicker. <br>A key strategy that I used was casting the White Mage's Confuse spell. Confused enemies will not split when hit with a physical attack! Use this to your advantage on encounters with three or four monsters to the greatest effect. Let enemies hit each other or themselves and follow up with a strong physical to take them out without dividing. Concentrate black magic spells on single targets to do more damage to get them within one-shot physical attack range. As you get further, you will get stronger and then be able to complete the dive, fight the boss, and get the achievement. <br>One other possibility is to simply ignore the items until after completing the challenge, and then dive back in with a party of Magic Knights to clear out the treasure. My luck with running from encounters in this dungeon (and pretty much the entirety of the late game) was non-existent so a Thief could aid with this approach as well. |
| ![Kneeling Monk sprite with red skin](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44161.png)<br>[Oops, Forgot My Sunscreen](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43052)<br>`Defeat Bahamut without casting Reflect(Wall)` | Oh boy... When I learned that Reflect was actually capable of sending Mega Flare back at Bahamut in this game, I was sad to see that this challenge prevents that. So, I used Bahamut's cave to prepare for this fight, raising my levels and job skill levels up to be able to take the hits from Mega Flare. Sometimes, you'll get lucky and Bahamut won't use the skill that much. Other times, it'll use it every single round! So, by building my levels to around 50-ish, I was able to survive just fine and take him out quickly. I used dual-wielding Knight and Magic Knight (I had been building my Knight to get the [Top of the Class](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43078) achievement) with a White Mage to heal and Black Mage to cast Bio. If your team is getting wiped by Mega Flare, you will just need to get more levels. <br>I didn't try this, but I believe using the Curtain(Barrier) item will also prevent getting this achievement, since the item has the same effect as Reflect(Wall). |
| ![A green circle at the center of a black swirl](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44186.png)<br>[The Gauntlet](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43076)<br>`Conquer both Syrcus(Sylx) and the Dark World without any Ninjas, Sages, or Onion Knights(Kids)` | This achievement works great in conjunction with [Overqualified](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43077) and [Top of the Class](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43078). Since the best jobs in the game are excluded from use in the final dungeons, go back to the Cave of Bahamut to grind and get these achievements with the party you want to use in the final stretch. Diving into Eureka is also beneficial to get the best weapons, spells, and armor for your team, on top of the experience you'll earn from the battles. By reaching level 65 with all of your characters, you will easily be able to finish this achievement with a well-balanced party. Eureka's weapons really push you toward using Knight with Ragnarok/Excalibur, Magic Knight with Masamune/Crysanth(Kiku), Devout(Shaman) with two Elder(Eldest) staffs, and Magus(Warlock) with Omnirod(Ultimate). This is the party that I completed the game with. |
| ![A rock](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44187.png)<br>[No Stone Unturned](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43079)<br>`Loot every single chest and hidden item in the game` | This is going to be one of the hardest achievements to complete as there are several locations that become inaccessible after certain story beats that can lock you out. RetroAchievements user [Gamechamp](https://retroachievements.org/user/Gamechamp) defined several locations in their [post](https://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=2232&c=48153#48153) regarding the following locations that are inaccessible after completing them: <br>- Nepto Temple(Shrine of Nepto) <br>- the Dwarves' Subterranean(Underground) Lake <br>- Castle Hein(Hyne) <br>- Doga(Dorga)'s Cave <br>- Lake Dohr(Dol). <br>I played with the maps from [RPGClassics](https://shrines.rpgclassics.com/nes/ff3/maps.shtml) to ensure that I found every chest in these dungeons in particular. I noted that there are some discussions on the [achievement page](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/43079) concerning various maps that don't show all of the hidden items, especially in some towns. The RPGClassics maps also don't have every location mapped, such as the Gurgan Gulch(Valley) which has a hidden path to three chests. Another strategy brought up is the use of the RALibretro achievement editor to see if an area has had all of its chests opened, but that requires leaving Hardcore Mode so I won't go into details on that here. |

Otherwise, you will need to get all of the spells onto one character, purchase duplicates at Doga(Dorga)'s Village, and probably use a Fat Chocobo to juggle things. |
|![Summoner sprite](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/44153.png)<br>[Supreme Summoner](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43066)<br>`Have every summon spell on one character` | I never used a summoner in my game, so I threw all of the summon spells onto my second character, who evolved from Monk to Black Belt(Karateka) to Magic Knight throughout the course of the game. Once I got Bahamut, I unlocked this achievement, and then put Bahamut on my Magus(Warlock) turned Sage during my post-game Onion equipment grind. Your mileage may vary but the point at which you unlock it remains the same. Don't forget to purchase the level 1-5 summon spells in Replito(Leprit)! |

This following guide is based on the work written in this GameFAQs strategy: [The Fully Equipped Onion Knight FAQ by OnionKid/SirBahamut](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/nes/563415-final-fantasy-iii/faqs/24510). Make sure you are using an emulator that supports Fast Forward. I use RALibretro or plain RetroArch while in Hardcore mode so that I can toggle fast forward and configure my controls to make things easier.

0. **Beat the game!** Seriously, play through the game and enjoy it first without attempting the Onion Equipment grind. Definitely work on the other achievements listed above as they will set you up for success here, especially the [Overqualified](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43077) achievement, as that will make the grind in the Syrcus(Sylx) Tower that much easier.

1. **Setup your party.** Since you beat the game and probably got [The Gauntlet](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43076), you should be just outside the Syrcus(Sylx) Tower when you restart your game. Time to put those Ninja and Sage jobs to work! You can accomplish this grind with two Ninjas and two Sages, or feel free to use three Ninjas if you want to make your climb up the tower just a bit easier. If you do opt to use one Sage, ensure that they have a good spread of high level healing and attack/summon spells. Curaja(Cure4) and Arise(Life2) are a must, Bahamut and Meteor(Meteo) can make some encounters go faster, and Breakga(Brak2) can work on the Dragons. Feel free to mix things up as you wish. However, know that the area of the Tower that we grind in only really needs two Ninjas, so two Sages can make things easier as far as spell distribution goes, especially if your party already has two spell casters set up for the [Supreme Magus(Warlock)](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43064) and [Supreme Devout(Shaman)](https://retroachievements.org/Achievement/43065) achievements.

2. **Climb up to the sixth or seventh floor.** The encounters at this location are easy to grind on, since all you'll see are single or a pair of DarkGenerals(D.General), Glasya Labolas(Grashara), or Thor lizards. No Kum Kum(QumQum) here to cast Death/Breakga(Brak2) on you! These floors will have the Yellow or Green Dragon respectively.

3. **Get comfortable!** You are about to do a TON of encounters in a row before the first Dragon appears. 128 of them to be exact! So, how can you get comfortable? First, set up your controls for your comfort. You can make it one handed by putting confirm/cancel on the L1/L2 (LB/LT) buttons if you are using a modern controller. If you are using an NES or SNES style controller, you'll need to use two hands. Second, add a shortcut for holding Fast Forward. Third, turn Fast Forward on. Now, your Fast Forward button on your controller can turn it off while you hold it down. This will make the game move quickly through battles while slowing down only when you need to menu or navigate the Tower accurately.

4. **Pace and grind!** Walk back and forth and fight battles. As stated before, the first Dragon encounter will take 128 fights to reach. Now that you are comfortable while grinding, feel free to turn on some YouTube/TV/Twitch/etc. while you pace and fight. Your Ninjas will make short work of the enemies you face here by simply holding down the A button. Each fight should only take one round at this point. With Fast Forward on, you should be able to get to your first Dragon in about 5-10 minutes. Make sure to heal with your Sages or your Elixirs as necessary (hold Fast Forward off). With one Ninja holding the Moonring(Full Moon), getting a back attack is not an issue. Do note that pacing left or right on Fast Forward while not paying full attention can result in a party member changing rows. You can try pacing up and down on these floors if you wish or just make sure to occasionally check on the state of your party, which you should do anyway to ensure no one has died.

5. **Fighting Dragons.** Your first Dragon appeared. Thankfully, this should be a non-issue at this point with your levels, equipment, and job classes. Continue to just attack! You could mix things up here as well by having one of your Sages use Bahamut or Breakga(Brak2). Feel free to slow the battle down here if you'd like. After it is killed, slow down to see the treasure drop. The achievement for Onion Equipment will pop as soon as the Gil earned appears, if you got a new piece of equipment.

6. **Continue fighting the Dragons.** The second dragon encounter will be in another 64-68 battles. Get comfortable with the grind again, but know that it isn't as far off. After that, the next dragon will appear in approximately 9 battles, and then the last dragon will arrive in about 6 battles. Feel free to go up to the seventh floor or down to the fifth floor if you want to mix things up. As I understand it though, all three dragons have the same drops, so changing floors is up to you as different dragons do not change your chances of getting Onion equipment.

7. **Reset the game!** You completed four dragon fights. The next dragon won't appear for approximately 171 battles! This is because the encounter lookup table holds 256 entries and goes through each battle in the table consecutively. With that knowledge, it is faster to simply reset the game and start over at 128 battles to the next fight. This is also a good chance to **take a break**! There is no need to do this grind all at once. You'll go crazy! Play a different game and come back later after one or two loops of this grind. If you'd rather save the drops and progress, feel free to climb back down and save outside of the tower. Thankfully, there isn't an achievement to have a Fully Equipped Onion Knight, so saving isn't necessary.

In conclusion, the Onion equipment grind isn't fun, but hopefully this process makes it a little more bearable.

### Notes for Revision

- **Protégé of Perseus**: I used a Warrior in the top party slot and three White Mages in the other three slots. The White Mages were placed in the rear row to minimize damage. I used White Mages because I was concerned about supporting with healing. Maybe I was fortunate, but Medusa only physically attacked twice through the whole battle, attempting to cast Break the rest of the time (and never landing the spell). I could just have easily had any party jobs provide healing and status ailment support with items. My back row party members just used Run unless I needed to throw a potion to heal when I did take a physical attack from Medusa. The Warrior was Character Level 10, Job Level 7, and attacked with the Salamand Sword that I got in the floor before Medusa. With these stats, I was doing around 90-110 damage per round. Money will largely dictate what items you'll have and jobs and associated equipment you may be using.

- **Chill Out**: I had my party using their primary jobs that had they had the most job levels in, including one Black Mage who was at Job Level 16 in my successful attempt. The party all together used physical and magic attacks until Gutsco's HP neared around 100-200 HP remaining. Yeah, I tracked the damage I was doing, keeping in mind that Gutsco(Guzco) has 1400 HP. Once in range, everyone used Guard or Run as appropriate while the Black Mage used Blizzaga and Blizzara to finish the job.

- **Pyro Punching Power**: Continuing with my primary jobs, I had them proceed through the Molten Cave until just before the Salamander fight. I then made my mages into jobs that I had the defensive equipment for and put them into the back row so that they could guard or provide healing items for support while my primary fighters (a Warrior and Monk) did the brunt of the damage dealing. If you have room for equipment, perhaps actually getting better weapons and armor could be helpful, but this fight isn't terribly difficult to complete with just the two damage dealers. You'll find a Ice Blade here, which will be a big benefit on your main Warrior, so you could pass the Salamand Sword to a backup Warrior as well. Also, South Winds may be used but they won't deal as much damage with your lower Intelligence party.

- **Seafood Soup**: It's good to prepare for this one ahead of time by getting your job levels up in the four Fire Crystal jobs. Raw character levels can also be useful. Make sure you have equipment for each of the jobs. A lot of equipment for these jobs are available right after you get them, such as in Argass Castle's unlockable rooms and in Hyne's Castle. You will probably still need armor for the Thief and Ranger(Hunter) though so do some shopping before leaving the Floating Continent. Kraken has no elemental weaknesses or defenses, so Scholar is a great candidate to use your spell item consumables for the most damage.

- **Robin Hood and His Merry Men**: Only Ranger(Hunter), Thief, and Bard jobs! If you are attempting to get **The Honest Approach** at the same time, that further limits your available jobs. With the poor to lack of equipment for the Ranger(Hunter) and Bard, my recommendation would be to do them separately by saving before entering the dungeon, making a rush at getting this one first with thieves as your DPS, then resetting and doing it again to get all of the chests and get **The Honest Approach** by going without thieves. Definitely get armor for Thieves in Amur as well as the Orichalcum dagger and Main Gauche in the Amur Sewers. Let your Bard and Ranger take the back row and provide healing with items. One reason to actually have a Bard is their Cheer ability, which helps to buff the thieves damage output over the course of the battle. So, have the Ranger(Hunter) applying healing, the Bard cheering, and the thieves attacking!

- **Or Maybe We Won't**: Before entering Saronia(Salonia) airspace, make a separate save file, just in case. If you have issues with the fight, this gives you opportunity to grind character and job levels elsewhere. I used Knight, Thief, and two White Mages. White Mages provided healing, Knight and Thief (with Orichalcum dagger/Black Cowl/Black Garb/Thief Gloves) attack. White Mage can support with Aero as well, since Garuda is weak to the wind element, but the damage is not nearly as good. Also unfortunate: there isn't any available armor to resist lightning elemental damage. With 5000 HP and high evasion, job levels are going to carry you a long way in this fight.

- **The Weight of Water**: You have a lot of choices with the Water Crystal jobs and plenty of equipment to scavenge from the Saronia(Salonia), the Underwater(Sunken) Cave, Temple of Time, Falgabard(Fargabaad), and more. Going on this equipment hunt also gives the opportunity to improve the job levels for the jobs you choose to use for the fight with Hecatoncheir(Hekaton). My lineup was two Dragoons, a Viking, and a Magic Knight. Big issue: Hecatoncheir(Hekaton) is in the Cave of Shadows(Darkness) so you will have to deal with dividing enemies. If you are going for **Divided They Fall** at the same time, substitute the Magic Knight with another Viking or other class while you slowly gain your job levels and work your way down a little at a time. See the strategy on **Divided They Fall** for more details there but have equipment ready to swap out mages for Water Crystal jobs when you approach the boss. If you do opt to do **Divided They Fall** separately from this one, the Genji Gear in the Cave of Shadows(Darkness) is available for the Magic Knight so a trip to Falgabard(Fargabaad) is not required. Achievement unprimed with my setup... Do I need to have separate jobs for every character? Yes! Oof! Change in plans then... Perhaps I'll use Black Belt(Karateka) instead of the second Dragoon. And yeah, confirmed that it requires different jobs for each character... That was a LOT of rework!

- **Blast Apart the Earth**: You have to get this achievement before getting **Teaching the Masters** because the latter requires the Earth Crystal jobs! The only legal jobs are: White Mage, Black Mage, Red Wizard, Scholar, Geomancer, Evoker(Conjurer), and Bard. I went with Black and White Mages and an Evoker(Conjurer). There is no restriction with the same job on multiple characters for this challenge. I like the idea of this challenge because the Earth Crystal jobs are only magical jobs so it is like showing proof of mastery of magic to the crystal guardian. The major problem is that Titan resists all elements! Using the Hyper spell (which can bring out the Titan summon) was quite effective, no matter if it was the White or Black version. If you have the levels and got Leviathan and Bahamut, perhaps those may be even better though Titan has more consistent damage output. For black magic, Bio was fairly effective. The White Mage is most effective at healing the party, of course. Titan (the boss) like to use Flare and physical attacks so keep on healing with the White Mage. It may be wise to have two White Mages to keep up the healing if the party's character and job levels are lower and just have one Black Mage and one Evoker(Conjurer).

- **Teaching the Masters**: After getting the Earth Crystal jobs, set up your party to have all four characters with the three jobs. As the achievement description says, one party member can share a job that another has. I went with two Magus(Warlock) as the shared job. For Doga(Dorga), Bio is very effective. Unei(Unne) can cast Reflect so be sure to heal if any spells get fired back! Summon damage will penetrate Reflect though so have your Summoner unleash their strongest available spells.
