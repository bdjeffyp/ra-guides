# My RetroAchievements Guides repo

This repo contains my collection of personal guides that I have written for the [RAGuides wiki](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/wiki). Since the wiki requires copy-pasting Github-flavored Markdown into a text box to edit/update guides rather than Git processes, this repo will be used to store my guides with Git. Pushes here will not result in updating the actual wiki guides until a manual copy-paste is performed.

## Contributing

If you wish to edit my guides, I'm open to it. Feel free to fork the repo and submit pull requests for changes.
