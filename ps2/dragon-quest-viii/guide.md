This is not an official manual, walkthrough, or critical review. This document is a guide for the current achievement set (208 as of March 11, 2024) available on [RetroAchievements](https://retroachievements.org/game/2721). This guide will give the player tips on earning the achievements, hash compatibility, and any other necessary or useful information. It may point to other resources for specific game walkthroughs that are not focused on the achievements themselves.

As with some of the other guides I've made, spoiler solutions for the boss strategies and a potential order to earning the achievements will be hidden in a collapsible entry that you must click to expand so that only the solutions you need assistance with will be viewable. Some of the more minor achievements will have strategies written outright without a collapsible dropdown so use the guide at your own risk.

## Introduction

Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King is a role-playing video game developed by Level-5 and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation 2. Released in Japan in November 2004 and then throughout the world between 2005 and 2006, it is the eighth installment in the Dragon Quest series. It is also the first game in the series to have a release in European regions as well as the first to finally have the "Dragon Quest" name, rather than "Dragon Warrior", in the United States. Additionally, it is the first game in the series to use fully 3D environment and characters, rather than 2D pixel art. It leverages cel-shading techniques to make Akira Toriyama's character and monster designs really shine in the 3D style.

Dragon Quest VIII continues the traditional story and gameplay styles of the previous games, using small vignettes across an overarching plot, iconic monster designs, a nameless and silent hero character with hidden abilities, and randomly encountered turn-based combat with experience points. A new alchemy system is introduced to create a new item out of two or three existing stock after a certain number of steps are walked. A skill point system enables character customization, forcing the player to make permanent choices with each level around weapons and attributes that can unlock new abilities and spells.

As with other role-playing games, Dragon Quest VIII will push you into situations that can lock you out of areas, characters, and abilities as you progress. As a result, many achievements for this game can become missable if you are not diligent. However, all achievements can be earned in one playthrough. This guide will attempt to help you in identifying the missable achievements if you'd rather not play this fantastic, but lengthy, game multiple times.

## Trivia

- Dragon Quest was called "Dragon Warrior" in the United States due to a trademark conflict with a tabletop role-playing game called [DragonQuest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DragonQuest). The US trademark expired in the early 2000s and Square Enix was able to use the series name in USA for the first time once they took over the trademark.

- The series, created by Yuji Horii, was inspired by western computer role-playing games Wizardry and Ultima, while incorporating a streamlined user interface more appropriate for a console video game experience. The first Dragon Quest's user interface is based off a Famicom port of Horii's game The Portopia Serial Murder Case, which used a command menu to get user input. Horii was frustrated with text-based entry of PC text adventure games and opted to have a command menu to simplify things.

- Many monsters were designed by famed mangaka Akira Toriyama, creator of Dragon Ball and many other manga and anime series. Perhaps arguably the most iconic and widely known monster is the Slime. Horii provided Toriyama [a sketch of a slime](https://bsky.app/profile/betterlegends.bsky.social/post/3kn6x6eufh622) based on Horii's playthroughs of Wizardry and Toriyama drew the teardrop shape with a smile that we are all familiar with.

- This achievement set, created by [TheMysticalOne](https://retroachievements.org/user/TheMysticalOne), makes good use of alliteration and puns similar to the style of Dragon Quest games. Early localizations of Dragon Quest to North America lacked the punny humor of the series, but Dragon Quest VIII's localization really set the standard for future games and remakes of the older games going forward. Spells started to use onomatopoeia names (like Kaboom instead of Explodet and Woosh instead of Infernos) similar to the Japanese style for spells while monster and town names started to lean in a punny direction.

- Dragon Quest VIII was ported to mobile phones and the 3DS. The 3DS version, in particular, adds two new playable characters and a bunch of quality of life improvements such as being able to speed up battle animations and instant alchemy pot brewing as soon as the feature is unlocked.

- The western release of Dragon Quest VIII added the affect of giving Hero a "Super Saiyan" appearance when hitting max tension. The [Dragon Quest wiki](https://dragon-quest.org/wiki/Tension) states that this was added specifically to the western releases as a shout out to fans of Toriyama's work, but I could not find any other sources that confirm if that is indeed the reason.

## Save Support

The game uses PS2 memory cards to save games with 30 save slots per card. Since this is being played with the PCSX2 emulator for RetroAchievements support, it is **HIGHLY** recommended that you make use of all slots in order to minimize the possibility of being locked out of a missable achievement. You can even make more than one memory card file to make saves across multiple memory cards. In my playthrough experience, I only needed one memory card, but I used 27 slots so I got close to needing more than one memory card.

## Compatibility

Currently (as of March 11, 2024) this game has 2 unique hashes registered for it. View the linked hashes at the [Supported Game Files](https://retroachievements.org/linkedhashes.php?g=2721) page. This includes a [60fps patch](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAPatches/blob/main/PS2/Improvement/2721-DQ8-60FPS.zip), if that is the sort of thing you enjoy.

## Potential Order

The following is a breakdown of the order of achievements based on my personal playthrough. Note that this is only a potential order for you to follow and not a strict timing on when achievements should be unlocked, especially when grind achievements are considered.

Each section is grouped under story achievements and hidden under a dropdown to avoid spoilers. If you want to see the achievements, **click on the arrow** next to each section to reveal the table. The dropdown names have the number of achievements in the section so that you can see at a glance about how many achievements you should have by the end of a section, if you were to follow my guide to the letter. If you want to see the entire thing without having to click the arrows, [checkout the fully expanded roadmap!](Dragon-Quest-VIII-Roadmap)

<br>The tables only reveal when achievements can be earned and possibly missed. No strategies on earning the achievements are provided here, just the approximate order I earned them in.

**Grind alert!** The final stretch will require a significant amount of time getting the remaining skill maxing as well as getting Hero to level 65 for the Dragon Soul ability. While there are probably plenty of good lower level strategies to beating the Dragovian Trials, it's probably more efficient to just get the levels and skills you need before completing the final Trial. In my playthrough, I made occasional breaks from metal slime grinding to go do a Dragovian Trial, and then head back to the grind. Have fun!

## Category Breakdowns

The category sections below contain each achievement in the section with tips or suggestions on how to unlock them. Not every achievement may warrant an in-depth discussion and the tips/suggestions I provide may not be the the most ideal. I'm open to feedback on how better to meet an achievement's requirements, as I have done with my previous guides. Feel free to [message me via RetroAchievements DM](https://retroachievements.org/messages/create?to=bdjeffyp) to discuss better strategies and I'll update them here with credit given.

Good luck in your achievement hunting!

### General advice

The following is some overall strategies to make your playthrough and achievement hunting with Dragon Quest VIII as painless as possible, while also completing your mastery in one run.

- **Alchemy recipe tracking**: I created a [checklist for tracking your progress on alchemy recipes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ce8GHR2nSsI-ArWagsF2-yS-t5rjWYEyFdRzfKcDAE/edit?usp=sharing) on Google Sheets. I didn't like that the [100% walkthrough guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/43062) didn't identify what the recipes made. It was also noted by RA user [Akai](https://retroachievements.org/user/Akai) in the [I Did 'Em Alchemyself achievement forums](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250749) that the 100% guide was missing one recipe. So, I used both the 100% guide as well as [Dragon's Den recipe guide](https://www.woodus.com/den/games/dq83ds/alchemy.php) to put together the checklist. The order of the recipes in the same as the 100% guide, with the one missing recipe at the very end of the list. With this checklist, I made sure to complete all recipes and verified its accuracy and completeness.

- **Saving**: Please, please, please, PLEASE make full use of your memory card! The last thing you want to do is make all of your saves on one slot. Dragon Quest VIII provides you with 30 slots per memory card. I am reiterating what was stated in the [Save Support](#save-support) section it is just that important. The best time to make a new save is just prior to making an attempt on a Challenge category achievement. Having multiple saves definitely helped me in a couple of instances where I missed an achievement because of a small timing window. Please don't forget to make use of all that space!

- **Dungeons and boss challenges**: The nature of how save games work in Dragon Quest games, combined with the [Peerless Protector](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250136) achievement's requirement, make dealing with dungeons and boss fight challenges a different level of tricky as compared to a typical Final Fantasy boss achievement. The way I mitigated these types of challenge achievements is by breaking up dungeons in two visits, when possible. The first visit (or more, if needed) is for clearing out the dungeon of treasures. Once that is done, Evac and Zoom to town to save. The next visit will then be for the attempts at the boss challenge. The nice thing about this approach is that death doesn't undo as much work when reverting to a previous save in order to maintain [Peerless Protector](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250136) while also ensuring that you are keeping your experience AND your money earned. If things get too spicy in a dungeon, don't be afraid to Evac early to recover and save your progress. This approach also helps with increasing distance traveled, brewing alchemy recipes, and maintaining new encounters logged in the bestiary.

- **Other guides**: The first time I played through Dragon Quest VIII completely was on the 3DS but I certainly didn't accomplish 100% of the game in that playthrough. In order to make sure I didn't miss anything while mastering this achievement set, the primary guide I utilized is the [100% walkthrough guide on GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/43062). As with most guides, there are bound to be errors but this one was nearly perfect. I also used the [Spells and Skills guide on GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/40285) for identifying my skill point distribution route. Also handy were the Dragon's Den overworld maps that identify [treasures](https://www.woodus.com/den/gallery/graphics/dq8ps2/maps_overworld/tresure_chests.webp), [notorious monsters](https://www.woodus.com/den/gallery/graphics/dq8ps2/maps_overworld/infamous_monsters.webp), and [cow locations](https://www.woodus.com/den/gallery/graphics/dq8ps2/maps_overworld/DQ8_Cows_Map.webp)!

### Story/Progression

No discussion on the story achievements here as you simply need to play through the game to earn them. You can't miss them!

### Side Quest

| Badge | Title | Strategy |
|:---:|---|---|
| [![Close up of squat monster with a purple hood over it's head](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/276707.png "Stop! Hammer Time")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250047) | [Stop! Hammer Time](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250047) | The hammerhood that blocks the way further into the waterfall cave will let you pass without a fight. Fight the hammerhood anyway and win to unlock the achievement. |
| [![A blue slime with smiley face jumping](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277333.png "Goo'd Faith")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250048) | [Goo'd Faith](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250048) | You can't miss this if you follow my general strategy for dungeons and bosses. Since this is in the first dungeon of the game, it may take you more than one visit to get to where the slime is. If your health is getting to dangerous levels, it may be ideal to leave early and heal. In my experience, I had two battles from the slime to the chest and back. If you can't survive those battles because health and resources are too low, leave without talking to the slime! Once you are ready, talk to the slime, say "yes", talk to the slime again, retrieve the sword from the chest, then return to the slime and talk again. |
| [![A gruff looking man with bushy gray moustache and beard](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277334.png "Oh Queso You Need Tools, Eh?")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250051) | [Oh Queso You Need Tools, Eh?](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250051) | Ideally best to complete this after the events of the waterfall cave. There are reports that the achievement did not unlock when performed prior. Additionally, you want to do this before going to Alexandria and having Bangerz following you. So, get the tools and give them to the cheese man on top of the hill after the waterfall and before heading to Alexandria. |
| [![Close up of a man-o-war squid with a smiley face](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/276715.png "Salty Yarns, Fresh Salvation")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250057) | [Salty Yarns, Fresh Salvation](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250057) | This was noted for having a tight timing window by the developer. Enter Port Prospect and save. Talk to the man o' war in the well. Do the Khalamari boss fight (kill it with Sizz if getting [Inkcinerated](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250056) at the same time). Return to the well and speak with the man o' war again to unlock it. Make liberal use of separate save files and this should be easy to get even with the tight timing. To be safe, I made sure **NOT** to speak with the man o' war until just before the Khalamari fight even with making early trips to Port Prospect while following along with the [100% walkthrough guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/43062). |
| [![Person crouched in front of treasure chest as they open it](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277430.png "Key Items")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250060) | [Key Items](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250060) | Once you have your alchemy pot, one of the first things to make is the Thief's Key. The game gives you plenty of hints to make this shortly after arriving at Perequin Quay, to include this guy who wants his chests open. You'll get free items AND the achievement! |
| [![A ring with a large pink jewel set in it](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277431.png "Silence Rings Wisdom")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250069) | [Silence Rings Wisdom](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250069) | There was [some talk](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250069) about this being potentially missable but I don't believe it is. The unfortunate thing about this is that there isn't much of a hint about who wants to see the Lady's Ring that I was able to find from talking to NPCs. You are supposed to just know/remember from earlier conversation that the short rich guy standing outside the right side of the Farebury church is the person who lost the ring in Ascantha. The person in question also migrates to the inn's second floor at night. Concerning the potential for this being missable, someone stated that the man leaves Farebury after the party gets the ship. So, once you have retrieved the ring from Ascantha's well, go Zoom directly to Farebury and talk to the man to complete the quest. |
| [![A three-quarter view of a King Slime and it's crown](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/276730.png "Welly done a Goo'd Deed")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250075) | [Welly done a Goo'd Deed](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250075) | You'll find a friendly king slime in the well next to my favorite inn and church at Hilltop Hut. Help the poor slime out and get your first slime crown as well as the achievement. |
| [![A gruff looking man with bushy gray moustache and beard with two cheese icons in the corner](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277434.png "Just Cheese, Cheese, Cheese")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250081) | [Just Cheese, Cheese, Cheese](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250081) | Congrats on getting a ship to sail the world! Now to revisit old places to open previously inaccessible chests. Also, go visit the cheese guy at the top of the Farebury waterfall to get some more cheese. |
| [![A bell](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/276738.png "Felix Felicis")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250085) | [Felix Felicis](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250085) | Chateau Felix is conveniently located next to Baccarat. Complete Felix's quest to help the spirit of Baumren and you'll get the bell that makes overworld travel much quicker. |
| [![Side profile of Princess Medea's face as she prays while in bright white light](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277436.png "Provisory Princess")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250087) [![Princess Medea's face](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/276744.png "Royal Reverie")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250092) [![Drawing of Princess Medea](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/276794.png "Enduring Endearment")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250124) | [Provisory Princess](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250087), [Royal Reverie](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250092), and [Enduring Endearment](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250124) | [Provisory Princess](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250087) is the event that kicks off the route to obtaining the elusive [Enduring Endearment](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250124) achievement. Once you have Baumren's Bell, head toward Argonia but go to the Mystical Spring first. The events there will unlock this achievement. <br>Now keep getting Medea to drink from the spring until you only have a "stolen moment". You will then be on track to continuing the [Enduring Endearment](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250124) achievement. You should see the measured notification when Medea successfully drinks from the spring and talks to you. If Medea is too full to drink, take some time to make alchemy recipes by walking around. You must walk in an area where you can hear Medea and the cart, so walking in towns and dungeons does not make Medea thirsty again. My ideal spot was just outside of Hilltop Hut. You can walk with Medea and have no encounters there. There should be two events at the spring before the "stolen moment" happens. <br>[Royal Reverie](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250092) is the event that tells you that you are ready to have two more Mystical Spring sessions with Medea. After every major story event now, Medea will talk to you in a dream, the first of which unlocks [Royal Reverie](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250092). Once you have a dream, return to the Mystical Spring and repeat the process of drinking, chatting, and walking with Medea until you only have "stolen moments". <br>There are 24 total dreams and Mystical Spring sessions with Medea to finally unlock [Enduring Endearment](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250124). Here is a breakdown of the major events that will trigger the next leg of dream and spring visits: <details><summary>Spoilers</summary><br>- Before Argonia: escorting Charmles and getting the magic mirror **[scenes 1-3]** <br>- Before end of Dark Ruins: you are directed there after getting the mirror so get all of the scenes before charging the mirror up and returning to the ruins **[scenes 4-6]** <br>- Before end of Arcadia scenario: got the dream (scene 7) sleeping at the inn in Arcadia after traveling there for the first time **[scenes 7-9]** <br>- Before end of Marta's scenario: got the dream (scene 10) sleeping at the inn in Arcadia after having defeated Evil Jessica and mourning the death of another great sage **[scenes 10-12]** <br>- Before end of the Godbird scenario: got the dream (scene 13) sleeping at the inn in Argonia while opening ultimate key locked doors **[scenes 13-15]** <br>- Before end of Sir Leopold's scenario: got the dream (scene 16) sleeping at the Hilltop Hut inn after defeating Gemon and getting the soulstone **[scenes 16-18]** <br>- Before Neos scenario: since you can start the Neos scenario right after Purgatory island, it is imperative that you rest at an inn for the dream (scene 19) and then get the two spring segments right away as the window for this one is short! **[scenes 19-21]** <br>- After Neos scenario: after the Black Citadel flies off, another inn rest will start the final dream (scene 22) and final Spring segments **[scenes 22-24]**</details> |
| [![A zombie behind a counter](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277437.png "Secretly Skillful")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250098) | [Secretly Skillful](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250098) | Check the abandoned shop in Arcadia at night time to purchase the goods that unlock this achievement. |
| [![Hero pushing on a statue](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/276749.png "Engoouragement")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250099) | [Engoouragement](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250099) | As you enter Rydon's Tower proper and get ready to climb it, a slime stands near a statue. Pushing the statue will cause the slime to give you some words of encouragement and hint at what the puzzle of the tower will be. |
| [![Close up of Cash's face](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277485.png "Compassionate Champion")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250761) [![Close up of Carrie's face](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277487.png "First Rate Reconcilor")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250763) | [Compassionate Champion](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250761) and [First Rate Reconcilor](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250763) | These are both missable because Cash and Carrie can resolve their dispute without your help if you don't step in before the Neos scenario. Besides, getting the Casino open as soon as possible is advantageous to you since there is some excellent equipment to get there. <br>The soonest you can start this is after the Arcadia events. Head to Baccarat and choose a side, then head to the Dragon Graveyard. <br>For [Compassionate Champion](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250761), there are 3 bodyguards. The priest is the first found, on a path off the main route in the second area. The magic user bodyguard is on the main route in the third area. The last one, the warrior, is on the main route laying down on the floor losing consciousness and must be spoken with twice (the measurement for the achievement says there are 4 events to meet the requirement). <br>[First Rate Reconcilor](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250763) will be earned once you defeat the bosses and unlock the casino. The boss strategy is discussed in the [Challenge](#challenge) section. |
| [![Bunny girl](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277810.png "Soft and Squishy")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250816) | [Soft and Squishy](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250816) | I went to Le Club Puff-Puff during the ultimate key treasure clean up and picked up the achievement then. You need the ultimate key to enter anyway so this is a perfect time to get the achievement while getting the treasures in the changing room. |
| [![Nook grass item](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/276771.png "Herbal Handout")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250121) | [Herbal Handout](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250121) | Tell Marek "yes" to receive four bits of nook grass. You can do this as soon as you have the Godbird's soulstone. I picked it up when doing treasure chest cleanup with Godbird before heading to Tryan Gully. |
| [![A flail](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/276782.png "Flailin' Felon")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250125) | [Flailin' Felon](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250125) | One of several side quests that becomes available after the events at Neos. Just chat with Red to get this. |
| [![A king squid monster](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/292754.png "Savouring the Squidly Silence")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/264890) | [Savouring the Squidly Silence](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/264890) | Defeat the king squid that has shown up outside of the casino in Baccarat. Refuse the first offer of 200 casino tokens, then accept the offer of 400 casino tokens. Taking that initial offer is why the achievement is missable. |
| [![A gruff looking man with bushy gray moustache and beard with three cheese icons in the corner](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/292755.png "Gonna Brie an Energizingly Gouda Time")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/264891) | [Gonna Brie an Energizingly Gouda Time](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/264891) | The Black Citadel's appearance triggers this next opportunity to get some fantastic cheese. The Godbird soulstone makes getting this convenient. Make sure to get this before defeating the postgame dungeon boss the first time. |
| [![Drawing of chancellor character](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/276784.png "Through the Looking Glass")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250127) | [Through the Looking Glass](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250127) | The Black Citadel's appearance also triggers this side quest. For some reason, a mirror in the chancellor's house in Argonia has a small dungeon in it. Complete the dungeon and save the chancellor's family to get the achievement. See the [Challenge](#challenge) section for this side quest's boss fight if you need help with that. |
| [![Kalderasha looking into a glowing crystal ball](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277439.png "Final Fortune")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250132) | [Final Fortune](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250132) | I was able to get this as soon as the Black Citadel went into the air. While doing treasure clean up and the final scenes for [Enduring Endearment](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250124), I went to Farebury to talk to Kalderasha not expecting this to pop then. I had figured that this achievement was for a scene after completing the Black Citadel. So, you might as well get it knocked out during the final treasure clean up before the end of the game. |
| [![The vermillion dragon form of the Lord](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277443.png "Vermillion is a Shade of Dead")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250701) [![The emerald dragon form of the Lord](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277444.png "Emerald Eradication")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250702) [![The silver dragon form of the Lord](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277445.png "Silver Slayer")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250703) [![The golden dragon form of the Lord](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277447.png "Aureate Assassin")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250704) [![The darksteel dragon form of the Lord](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277448.png "Steel Smelting Superman")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250705) [![The divine dragon form of the Lord](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277449.png "Divine Destroyer")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250706) [![The ultimate dragon form of the Lord](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277450.png "Ultimate Dragon Warrior")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250707) | [Vermillion is a Shade of Dead](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250701), [Emerald Eradication](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250702), [Silver Slayer](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250703), [Aureate Assassin](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250704), [Steel Smelting Superman](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250705), [Divine Destroyer](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250706), and [Ultimate Dragon Warrior](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250707) | The majority of the post game is spent preparing for these battles, especially the Ultimate Dragon gauntlet. Since these achievements are not missable, I am not going to go into specific strategies for beating these bosses as there is a lot of variance depending on your specific equipment, levels, and skill point distributions. There are other guides out there that go into details on these battles that could do it better than I. This is another area where the [100% walkthrough guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/43062) was not complete on, so the final few boss fights were attempted on my own. Ultimate Dragon is definitely the scariest, as that is actually a boss rush prior to fighting the actual boss. Good luck on this final challenge the game has for you! |

### Cutscene

| Badge | Title | Strategy |
|:---:|---|---|
| [![Red bandana wearing hero looks with a blank faced expression](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/276629.png "Loyal Subject from the Start")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250044) | [Loyal Subject from the Start](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250044) | Say "yes" to King Trode when you first arrive in Farebury to unlock the achievement. Show that dedication to the monarchy! If you say "no", you'll just have to start the game over from the beginning, so that's not too bad. |
| [![Back of green tunic wearing person running away](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/276630.png "Zooming Zoomer")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250045) | [Zooming Zoomer](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250045) | Talk to the person with the bowl cut hairstyle and green tunic after entering Farebury to make him run away... The cutoff for missing this cutscene would be when the townspeople chase out King Trode. |
| [![Close up of angry looking person's face](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277264.png "Zippy Zoomer Zooms Away Again!")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250046) | [Zippy Zoomer Zooms Away Again!](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250046) | After the cutscene where the townspeople chase away King Trode, talk to the bowl cut guy with the green tunic once more. I'm not sure what the cutoff is for this achievement to be missable so just make sure you talk to the guy again shortly after re-entering Farebury. |
| [![A close up on Marcello's face as he smirks](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/276718.png "Worm Welcome")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250061) | [Worm Welcome](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250061) | You won't miss this one, so not much to say here. Go to the Maella Abbey and meet Marcello. |
| [![Close up of Yangus grinning](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/276719.png "Brawlroom Baller")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250062) | [Brawlroom Baller](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250062) | This event occurs when entering Simpleton and speaking with Angelo the first time. <br>Apparently, you can skip past this and head to Ascantha first, which will cause this event to be missed. This is not ideal since skipping Angelo for that long of a period is not advisable, even if you are concerned about [Dhoulmagus Defeated Despite Having Haphazard Healing](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250096). Additionally, skipping Angelo would cause you to miss out on [Two Traumas](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250068) so overall that's not recommended. |
| [![A map](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/276724.png "I love my map. I’d be lost without it.")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250067) | [I love my map. I’d be lost without it.](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250067) | Simply open up the world map once you leave Maella Abbey. You'll be doing this a LOT anyway while looking for overworld treasure chests so you'll get this eventually. FYI, opening the world map from the menu after you get it from Marcello while still in the Abbey does not cause the achievement to pop, so wait until you leave the Abbey and then press the Square button. |
| [![A close up on a young Marcello face to face with young Angelo](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/276726.png "Two Traumas")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250068) | [Two Traumas](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250068) | With Angelo in your party, sleep in the Riverside Chapel en route to Ascantha. This is missable if you progress too far into the story, so make sure you stay there. If you are following along with the [100% Walkthrough guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/43062) and collecting treasure in the area prior to heading to Ascantha, you'll definitely make use of the chapel and shouldn't miss this. |
| [![Close up of a fortune teller's face](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277432.png "Fortuitousless")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250071) | [Fortuitousless](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250071) | I initially missed this one because I spoke with Trode in the Pickham bar to have Medea stolen without talking to the fortune teller first. Thankfully, I used multiple saves and was able to reload to get this achievement specifically before reloading the later save to progress further. The reason this happened is because **the fortune teller was not in their tent at night** which was when I was exploring the town. So, make sure you rest to get to day time if it is night before stopping inside the fortune teller's tent. Lesson learned and reinforced: MAKE MULTIPLE SAVES!! |
| [![Side profile close up of Rolo's face](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277433.png "Brotherhood Bullying")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250080) | [Brotherhood Bullying](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250080) | After you get the ship and while touring the world looking for new treasures to get, stop in Neos to get this cutscene. This is missable if you progress too far into the story though that cutoff is not known currently. It won't be a problem though if you go to Neos and walk up to the large doors in the back of the town as soon as you get the ship. |
| [![Side profile of Marcello's face and upper half of torso](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/276759.png "Condescending Crusader")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250108) | [Condescending Crusader](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250108) | Take a trip to Savella Cathedral and check out the elevator to bump into Marcello and pop the achievement. Again, this is missable by progressing too far into the story. I got this after visiting the Dark Ruins the first time and needing to get the magic mirror, as directed by the [100% Walkthrough guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/43062). |
| [![Side profile of the Lord High Priest](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277438.png "Showing Shade on the Forefront")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250115) | [Showing Shade on the Forefront](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250115) | After having Godbird access, head to the Lord High Priest's residence right away! Land on the island and try to open the gate into the residence and the cutscene will play out. As with the other Marcello events, progressing too far into the story will lock this one out. |
| [![King Trode enjoying a beverage](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/276767.png "Shaken Drink, Stirring Tale")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250117) | [Shaken Drink, Stirring Tale](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250117) | Simply go to the pub as King Trode in Tryan Gully, talk to the bartender, and accept the offer of a drink and a tale. It does not appear to be missable, but I made sure to do this cutscene as soon as I arrive in the village. |
| [![Chen Mui's face](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277072.png "Familiar Family or Family Familiar?")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250526) | [Familiar Family or Family Familiar?](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250526) | Speak to Chen Mui after helping the Dragovians to learn the truth. |
| [![Tombstone](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277263.png "Tragic Togetherness")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250527) | [Tragic Togetherness](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250527) | Once you've learned the truth from Chen Mui, you can head to the tombstone you passed on the Dragovian Path just outside of the Sanctuary to see this cutscene. |
| [![Chen Mui's face and upper torso](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277335.png "Couple o' Cheeseheads")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250528) | [Couple o' Cheeseheads](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250528) | Who do you know that loves cheese as much as Munchie? Talk to them once more after saving the Dragovians to view this cutscene. <br> <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>It's the old man at the hut on top of the waterfall near Farebury.</details> |

### Cor Blimey

| Badge | Title | Strategy |
|:---:|---|---|
| [![Yangus shocked in the Tower of Alexandria](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/276713.png "COR BLIMEY!")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250055) | [COR BLIMEY!](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250055) | Unlocked automatically during the events at the top of Alexandria Tower |
| [![Yangus shocked](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/276722.png "COR BLIMEY!!")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250065) | [COR BLIMEY!!](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250065) | Unlocked automatically during the events at Maella Abbey |
| [![Startled Yangus](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/276728.png "COR BLIMEY!!!")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250073) | [COR BLIMEY!!!](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250073) | Unlocked automatically after the Pickham scenario wraps up |
| [![Startled Yangus](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/276735.png "COR BLIMEY!!!!")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250082) | [COR BLIMEY!!!!](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250082) | The first missable Cor Blimey event. After getting the ship, collecting treasures, and then heading to the western continent to pick up Dhoulmagus' trail, go to Seaview Chapel and speak to the monks there to get this scene. |
| [![Startled Yangus](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/276736.png "COR BLIMEY!!!!!")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250083) | [COR BLIMEY!!!!!](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250083) | The second missable Cor Blimey event, so soon after the first! The cutoff for this event is the Casino opening so the ideal time to do this is when you first arrive in Baccarat on your way to Chateau Felix and Argonia. Go into the inn and head downstairs to the theatre. Talk to the bartender in there. Next, go upstairs to overhear the conversation between the bartender and Golding's bodyguard. Finally, go back to the basement and talk to the theatre bartender again. |
| [![Startled Yangus](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/276739.png "COR BLIMEY!!!!!!")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250086) | [COR BLIMEY!!!!!!](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250086) | Unlocked automatically at the Mystical Spring |
| [![Yangus picking his nose](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/276740.png "COR BLIMEY! Party Chat Edition")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250088) | [COR BLIMEY! Party Chat Edition](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250088) | Another missable event and it seems to have a small window to get it. After getting lost in Dark Ruins and told to go to Argonia, you must enter party chat once in town but **BEFORE** going into the castle! I even missed this initially, but thankfully kept a save just before going into the castle that I was able to use to reload and get the scene. |
| [![Startled Yangus](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/276746.png "COR BLIMEY!!!!!!!")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250094) | [COR BLIMEY!!!!!!!](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250094) | Unlocked automatically during events in the Dark Ruins |
| [![Startled Yangus](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/276753.png "COR BLIMEY!!!!!!!!")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250102) | [COR BLIMEY!!!!!!!!](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250102) | This happens directly after the fight with Evil Jessica! Dominico asks you if you would have the honour of finishing her off. Say yes and Trode will run in and... COR BLIMEY! If you choose the wrong option, you'll have to do the Evil Jessica fight again. |
| [![Back of Yangus' head](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/276755.png "Cor Blimey.")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250104) | [Cor Blimey.](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250104) | This is missable because of what will occur to Marta's place after progressing through the story. When you leave Marta's cottage after her rescue and re-entering to get the mini-medal from the barn, head around back to the nook grass herb garden to get this cutscene and achievement. |

### Challenge

:no_entry: **HERE, THERE BE SPOILERS!** :no_entry:

This is where the meat of the achievement set is at! If you wish to challenge yourself, I recommend not expanding the strategies I used to complete these fun and puzzling achievements. Make use of nearby save spots where possible and experiment with the skills and items you have to complete these very awesome challenges!

| Badge | Title | Strategy |
|:---:|---|---|
| [![Mist dragon](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/109793.png "The Steel and the Mist")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108640) | [The Steel and the Mist](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108640) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Don't attack while she is in Mist form, only while in Dragon form. Take a couple of rounds of attacks for both Kain and Cecil and then wait for it to change forms. Repeat until dead. Use mist form rounds for healing if necessary. </details> |
| [![Soldier with a sword](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/109814.png "No Messengers Left")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108641) | [No Messengers Left](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108641) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Take out two guards, then concentrate on the General. Killing all three guards first will result in the General fleeing the battle. </details> |
| [![Giant squid with an evil toothy smile](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/109818.png "Tako Express")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108642) | [Tako Express](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108642) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>This is your first test of speed and strength. I recommend lowering the battle speed to 6 in order to give your characters more chances to attack. If you are still having trouble defeating Octomamm with a large enough hit to kill him before he goes to one leg remaining, you may need to grind a bit for levels to raise your base strength. </details> |
| [![An insectoid monster with bug eyes and gaping toothy mouth](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/110965.png "Reactionless Jaws")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108643) | [Reactionless Jaws](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108643)      | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>_Unfortunately, I didn't keep notes on this fight and don't have a save nearby to verify my memory here..._ Don't physically attack! Using Cecil's Dark is key, since that is not a physical attack and doesn't consume MP. Keep Cecil's health up with potions from Edward and Rydia. Another possibility is to have Edward Sing and hope that it causes the Charm status effect so that the Antlion attacks itself. </details> |
| [![Large red bomb-type monster](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/111289.png "Explosive Sync")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108644) | [Explosive Sync](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108644) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>When Mom Bomb grows full size, cease attacks. A party member will say, "It's gonna blow!". As it explodes and begins to split into the six bombs, use a Silk Web item to slow the bombs immediately. Have Yang use Kick to knock down the health of all the bombs slightly. Now cycle to Edward and have him attack each blue bomb individually to get their health in range, hopefully without critical hits. Once all three blue bombs were attacked without dying, a single Dark command from Cecil should take them all out in one shot and the achievement will be awarded. </details> |
| [![Horned zombie demon](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/113138.png "Malebranche of Earth")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108645) | [Malebranche of Earth](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108645) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Use Palom's Boost command until maxed out (6 times?). Then have Palom cast Fira on Scarmiglione. This will meet the requirement of taking out the boss with only one action **on him!** My Palom was Level 19 when I got this achievement. </details> |
| [![Serpent faced humanoid with snakes for hands](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/113431.png "Minimalist Struggle")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108646) | [Minimalist Struggle](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108646) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Note that party members can die but must be alive before the battle ends! Make sure to save in the Ancient Waterway. Have Tellah cast Mini on your party prior to entering the central hall of Baron Castle. Since you are Mini, Palom cannot use his Boast command to strengthen his spells. Palom should use his strongest spells: Quake, or Bio if Quake isn't available yet. I recommend getting Quake unlocked in the Ancient Waterway if you don't have it though. Buff your party with Tellah and Porom casting Blink to avoid taking too much damage. Since Baigan's body counters spells with Reflect, use low level spells on his body to wear off the effect. I used Cure twice on him to bounce a healing spell back at my party while wearing off his Reflect. It can take two hits before the Reflect wears off. Once it does, use Quake again to win. </details> |
| [![Turtle demon surrounded by raging waters](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/113433.png "Malebranche of Water")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108647) | [Malebranche of Water](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108647) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>No one can die this time around. Since you just fought Baigan, it would be wise to return to the Ancient Waterway to save your game again. You can use a Tent here or use Cecil's bed to heal up as well. If you have your battle speed at or near "1", you may want to lower it. I found that Cagnazzo is too quick and fires off Haste before Tellah is even able to cast a spell when the battle speed was at "1". Once I lowered the speed down to "6", this challenge was in the bag. Have Palom cast Bio and Tellah cast Thundaga, skipping everyone else. Those two spells should put Cagnazzo inside his shell before he casts Haste if it doesn't kill him outright. Cast one more Bio or Thundara/Thundaga to finish up the fight. </details> |
| [![Squat, yet long limbed, creature with long hair and a horn](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/117082.png "Winds of Victory")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108648) | [Winds of Victory](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108648) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Only the Dark Dragon phase of this fight matters for the achievement. Dark Dragon is susceptible to Tornado (hence the name of the achievement). Care must be taken to not have actions queued when the Dark Elf changes into the Dark Dragon as any extra actions taken will invalidate the achievement. In my many attempts, I found that my party took 10 attack actions on the Dark Elf before it changed. Your party levels may be different though so use caution around 7-8 attacks on the Elf. Once it does change, use Tornado and then follow with an attack from any other character. Do note though that Tornado still has a chance to fail. If it does fail, it still counts as an action on the boss and thus a reset is required. It can be annoying to reset and then deal with the story stuff and equipment changes but fast-forward is your friend... </details> |
| [![Three women: one tall with a spear and one short with a knife](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/117122.png "Magical Miscalculation")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108649) | [Magical Miscalculation](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108649) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Some have talked about Tellah having Dispel and using that to cancel out the Reflect status on Cindy; however, my Tellah did not have Dispel. I also saw people talk about casting Silence on Sandy so that she can't cast Reflect. I was never able to get Silence to stick though. So, I attacked Cindy until her health was low, doing approximately 4000 HP of damage. Note that Cid's Study and Libra spells don't work, so you'll have to keep track of the damage dealt in your head. When you think you are close, kill Sandy. While Cid, Yang, and Cecil attack Sandy, have Tellah cast Cura on Cindy to try to wear down her Reflect status. I found that when Sandy puts Reflect on Cindy, the status will stay on just until I have killed Sandy, which will then expose Cindy to Mindy's spells. If you time it right and have Cindy's health low enough, Mindy will end up killing Cindy and the achievement will pop. There may be better ways to do this, but this is the process that worked for me. Make sure you save right after this fight since another boss challenge follows shortly after this! </details> |
| [![Woman with long hair wrapped around her like a whirlwind](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/117137.png "Malebranche of Wind")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108650) | [Malebranche of Wind](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108650) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Yang's Focus will be the primary damage dealer since you can't use Kain's Jump to break up Barbariccia's whirlwind form. Focus will ignore the defense of the whirlwind. So, focus your efforts on keeping everyone alive and not fully petrifying. Cecil and Rosa can provide healing and Esunas. Cid and Kain can use Gold Needles and healing potions. There is some luck involved in this with Barbariccia's Tornados landing their hit or not. If the Tornado does connect, heal that character immediately (Yang should still Focus though). If Barbariccia does her follow up physical attack on the tornado'd character, they'll die. You may benefit from lowering your battle speed on this fight. Barbariccia's Ray does gradual petrification. So you have a few rounds before you need to cure the effect. You'll know it is close when the character looks like they are fully stone but still standing and able to act. If Gold Needles are running low, take a chance and only recover the debuff when they look like they are fully grey. Do note that Ray cast on the same character multiple times speeds this up. If a character gets hit by Ray twice in a row, focus on curing the affected person. </details> |
| [![Large and creepy doll with crown and hair in pigtails](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/117225.png "Danse Macabre")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108651) | [Danse Macabre](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108651) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>For every Calca doll taken down, a Brina doll must also fall. Attack on Brina doll, then kill one Calca. Continue attacking the dolls in pairs like that. When there is only one pair remaining, the Brina doll is weaker so that should be the last doll standing. Concentrate attacks on the last Calca doll and all attacks will then shift to the final Brina, which should fall quickly before it can change to Calcabrina. </details> |
| [![A small person pilots a giant humanoid robot](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/117412.png "Clockwork Destruction")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108652) | [Clockwork Destruction](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108652) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>The first phase of the fight, when Dr. Lugae and Baranab are separate, use Haste spells and Hermes items to speed up the entire party. Attack Baranb until it falls. Bring up Yang's menu. As soon as Dr. Lugae talks about taking manual contrl, select the Focus command. Have the next character use a Silk Web item or cast Slow on Barnab-Z. Now have everyone attack. I managed to get lucky on my attempt and Rosa did a critical hit with Aim, followed by Yang's standard attack killing Barnab-Z. I think even without the crit, I was on track to beating out Baranb-Z's explosion with everyone attacking, Rosa Aiming, and Rydia casting Thundara. </details> |
| [![Red faced demon draped in red and blue cape with hand extended](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/117556.png "Malebranche of Fire")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108653) | [Malebranche of Fire](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108653) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>Perhaps the toughest challenge?? Rosa needs to know Reflect, which she learns at level 36. This fight is a matter of timing. Since you cannot target Rubicante directly, you will need to set Reflect on a party member and then have Rydia bounce Blizzara off that character. This will take about 11 hits to accomplish (my Rydia at level 36 required that many hits). Rubicante's pattern: opens his cloak and uses his Scorch technique, closes his cloak, physically attacks one or two characters, and repeats. Rosa should cast Reflect on a surviving party member after Rubicante's physical attacks, which should be cast before he opens his cloak. Ensure Rydia is ready to cast as soon as Rubicante opens his cloak, then select the Blizzara spell and target your party member that has the Reflect status. This should hit Rubicante before he uses Scorch. If Rubicante Scorches, he will close his cloak immediately after, so it is very important to cast Blizzara as he opens his cloak or you will miss. Contingencies will be needed as party members are attacked and die. Edge, Cecil, and Kain should be using Phoenix Downs to revive characters. If Rosa or Rydia are taken out, you may miss a cycle. Take time to breathe and think through every action. I found this challenge to be very intense because of the concentration needed and finding the rhythm. It was very satisfying to accomplish! In my first attempt at this, I didn't have nearly enough Phoenix Downs and needed to leave the Tower of Babil to stock back up. In my second attempt, I was trying to keep people healed with Cecil's Cura or Hi-Potions, but found that would cause problems with the cycle so I only focused on raising dead party members. Keeping people alive increases targets for Rubicante's attacks and thus less chance of targeting Rydia or Rosa. Of course, balance is key. If you can't get back into a cycle because he keeps taking out your party, take some rounds to restore with stronger spells or items and then get back into the rhythm again. Good luck!! </details> |
| [![The facade of a toothy grinning demon emerging from a wall](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/117870.png "Under Pressure")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108654) | [Under Pressure](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108654) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>After the final save point in the Sealed Cave, there is one more TrapDoor to face before entering the Crystal Chamber. You may want to defeat the door before setting yourself up for this fight and possibly go back up to the save point, just in case. Set battle mode to Active and lower battle speed AND battle message to 6. Active is required for the achievement and a speed of 6 will give you more time to react. If you cleared out the Sylph Cave prior to going to the Sealed Cave, the Avenger Sword can be beneficial. Use a Silk Web or cast Slow to slow down the Demon Wall, use Bacchus Wines or cast Berzerk on your front line, and have Rydia summon Leviathan. The Silk Web will cause Demon Wall to retaliate with a gradual petrification spell, but you can ignore it since you will beat the boss before that takes full effect. Characters won't be able to do anything until the wall has already moved two times and probably won't make their first actions after the third movement. I tried this a few times, changing the battle speed to see when I can get my party to act sooner, but a speed of 6 for both battle speed and message was key. Additionally, I got good damage rolls from Rydia's Leviathan and a crit from Edge, so luck may play a part in this. I also moved items and spells around in order to put them where the cursor appears in the menu to speed up my actions. Another possibility could be to Haste party members, especially the one with the Avenger Sword or Rydia (but I haven't tried this...). </details> |
| [![The faces of the four malebranches](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/118439.png "Fiendish Rematch")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108655) | [Fiendish Rematch](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108655) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>If you did some grinding for Alerts/Sirens and repeatedly fought monsters summoned by the Searchers, you will have no issues with the Arch Fiends this time around. Fusoya's Bless keeps health bumped up with Rosa supplementing healing. Rosa should focus on anyone who get's dangerously close to low health (especially Edge). Use Rydia's opposing third level elemental spell or Bahamut if you have him at this point, Haste Cecil and have him attack, use Edge's opposing elemental Ninjutsu as appropriate also. </details> |
| [![Three floating metallic spheres](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/118446.png "Fatal Error")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108656) | [Fatal Error](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108656) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>The order to take down the nodes is Defense, CPU, Attack. If the Defense and Attack nodes are killed before the CPU, you will lose this challenge. So, the biggest concern is accidentally killing the Attack node before the CPU is defeated. Since the CPU casts Reflect on itself, you have no choice but to physically attack it. Have Fusoya keep your health up with Bless to negate the Attack node's paltry attack beams and keep on attacking the CPU. Once that is down, kill the Attack node and the achievement will pop! </details> |
| [![A shadowy ghost howling](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/i.retroachievements.org/Badge/118874.png "Cosmic Duel")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108657) | [Cosmic Duel](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/108657) | <details><summary>Strategy</summary>This should be easy enough if you have been grinding for the Adamant Armor. Have a healthy stack of Elixirs available as well, which you should have enough money to buy a bunch from the Flan Princess fights. When the battle with Zeromus begins and everyone is revived by your friends, kill them off again before using the Crystal. With the final battle now beginning, switch between attacks and using Elixirs. You may have some opportunities to get two attacks in, depending on if Zeromus used Flare, Meteor, or Holy on you successfully. You should have too much difficulty with this at this point though, if you have been working on getting everything you need for all of the achievements in one playthrough. Do note though that you will have to fight Zeromus twice in order to get this achievement as well as Shadow Hands. I opted for Shadow Hands first and then followed up with Cosmic Duel.<br/><br/>A brilliant suggestion by [Kencussion](https://retroachievements.org/user/Kencussion) regarding getting both Shadow Hands AND Cosmic Duel in one battle:<br/>"Keep your whole party alive when you start battle with Zeromus, but do NOT use the Crystal right away. The achievement for beating Zeromus with only Cecil begins once the Crystal is used... so before you use the Crystal, have Edge steal the Dark Matter from Zeromus' first form to get the 'Shadow Hands' achievement. Then kill off everyone in your party except Cecil (you may want Rosa to buff Cecil first), and then have him use the Crystal on Zeromus. When Zeromus reveals his second form, only Cecil will be alive and you can get the 'Cosmic Duel' achievement!"</details> |

I highly recommend it for filling out any of the blank spots. If you are thorough in fighting encounters as you progress through the game's story, you will probably have very few gaps by the time you hit the postgame. <br>The only things that were really missing by the time I got to the post game, other than the Dragovian trial enemies, were monsters in the ocean and beaches. Crayzee proved to be problematic initially, as I was searching the beach south of Argonia at night. However, it never seemed to show there, so I feel like that was the wrong place. I did find Crayzee fairly quickly once I Zoomed to the Pirate's Cove and whistled for encounters at the entrance. Foul Anchor also caused some problems because they seemingly can just appear anywhere in the ocean. I found them when sailing from the unexplored island where I searched for the Abyss Diver heading north toward the Dark Ruins island. |

As mentioned in [General advice](#general-advice), I used [this map of every monster location](https://www.woodus.com/den/gallery/graphics/dq8ps2/maps_overworld/infamous_monsters.webp) to hunt them all down. This does **NOT** include the post game monsters and Hev, however. |

The very last monster, Hev, is a metal king slime that appears only when chosen as one of the items after winning against the Lord of the Dragovians. The new notorious monster appears south of Trodain Castle near a small lake. Hev is definitely a good addition to one of the teams! I even used Hev with the two heal slime monsters, Healer and Curer, as a part of my strategy for the final Dragovian Trial. <br>The other five monsters are not on [the map of notorious monster locations](https://www.woodus.com/den/gallery/graphics/dq8ps2/maps_overworld/infamous_monsters.webp) so I have included screenshots of where I was on the map when I found them, as other resources have not been specific enough in some cases.

The Black Citadel map, if missed, is not counted in the items list and so you won't miss the item achievements. In any case, if you are following along with the [100% walkthrough guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/43062) carefully, you won't miss any chests and thus won't miss any unique items either. |

The [Alchemy Recipe Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ce8GHR2nSsI-ArWagsF2-yS-t5rjWYEyFdRzfKcDAE/edit?usp=sharing) I created on Google Sheets is designed to give you a way to check off your progress while telling you how many you have completed in total. Simply make a personal copy of the checklist into your own Google Drive account and you'll be able to track your progress on these achievements as you play. <br>The reason why [I Did 'Em Alchemyself](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250749) is missable is because the Icicle Dirk is limited in availability. There are only two of them in the game and BOTH are needed for recipes. If you have been working toward the [Hoarder Hero](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250137) challenge achievement, this should not pose an issue though, since the main way these weapons could be lost is by selling them. The only other issue would be duplicating one of the recipes. If you make use of the [Alchemy Recipe Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ce8GHR2nSsI-ArWagsF2-yS-t5rjWYEyFdRzfKcDAE/edit?usp=sharing) however, you shouldn't have any worries of that either. <br>Late game recipes will require orichalcum and slime crowns, which have pretty terrible drop rates from some elusive enemies. Fortunately, you will get 6 orichalcum throughout the natural course of the game and you only need 1 more to complete all recipes. Pandora's box have a "common" drop rate for orichalcum at a rate of 1/128. Metal king slimes can also drop orichalcum but the drop rate is 1/256. As for slime crowns, there are two provided normally in game and you only need 1 more. Metal king slimes have a "common" drop rate for slime crowns at a rate of 1/128 so hopefully you'll get lucky during your metal slime grinds. |

Using the [100% Walkthrough guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/43062), I needed 502,000 tokens for everything it recommends, which won't take long with saves/resets. The guide also provides pointers for getting to the 22000 tokens amount that will make roulette much less painful since money is probably tight anyway without being able to sell for [Hoarder Hero](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250137). <br>Happy gambling! |

### Grind

My overall strategy when grinding is as follows:
- **Combat**: Once you have the Godbird's soulstone, you can fly to Howlwind Hill, also known as Slime Hill, located just north of Rydon's Tower. All slime family enemies are here, including metal slime variants. Just stay in one spot, Whistle for an encounter, and fight! Mercurial/Lightning Thrust and Hatchet Man/Executioner are your friend. Unfortunately, after completing the Black Citadel, dark slimes and sabrecats will also appear here, which can slow down the amount of metal slimes that make an appearance... Prior to the Black Citadel, metal slimes seem to appear frequently at all times. After Black Citadel, they only really seem to appear most at night. In other news, I seemed like I was able to intimidate more enemies during the postgame so I built up my intimidate count here too. I did check out the unexplored island and found the liquid metal slime appearance rate to be too little compared to Slime Hill. Getting the Metal King Boomerang can help with the regular metal slime groups that show up too. I was able to take down a 6 out of 9 metal slimes using that boomerang along with Executioner and Angelo with a metal king sword.
    - I am a big fan of seeing this encounter which seemed to show up a decent amount during my time on Slime Hill before the Black Citadel:
![An enemy encounter consisting of a Metal King Slime flanked by three Liquid Metal Slimes on both sides](./favorite-encounter.png)
- **Alchemy brewing**: Before getting the instant pot, once I got the Hilltop Hut zoom spot unlocked, I use the fenced in area outside the hut to run in circles while fast forwarding the emulator at 300%. This was also a useful spot for speeding up Medea's water consumption when working on getting Mystical Spring scenes for [Enduring Endearment](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250124).

| Badge | Title | Strategy |
|:---:|---|---|
| [![Close up of the small alchemy pot with the number 30 in the corner](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277531.png "Basic Brazen Brewer")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250742) | [Basic Brazen Brewer](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250742) | You got an alchemy pot! Thanks, King Trode! Now it is time to do your **ABCs**: Always Be Cooking! If you always have something in the pot, even repeated brewings of medicinal herbs, you will easily get the 30 brews completed before the improved alchemy pot is created. It is missable because if you get the improved alchemy pot before brewing 30 times, this achievement will be locked out. |
| [![Large alchemy pot with the number 100 in the corner](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277532.png "Stewing Stalwart")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250743) | [Stewing Stalwart](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250743) | Cooking 100 items in the improved alchemy pot seems like a lot, but if you are doing your **ABCs** (Always Be Cooking), then this should come with ease. It's missable because getting the final upgrade in the postgame will lock this achievement out. But since the time between getting the improved pot after getting Medea back from Red and the postgame unlock of the instant pot is a VERY long time, this shouldn't be an issue if you are persistent in getting new recipes unlocked _and_ cooking repeats. |
| [![Drawing of Hero at max tension](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277490.png "Masterful Mettle")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250767) [![Drawing of Yangus at max tension](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277491.png "Straight an' Narrow")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250768) [![Drawing of Jessica at maximum tension](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277492.png "Powerful Puff-Puff Professional")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250769) [![Drawing of Angelo at max tension](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277493.png "Je Ne Sais Quoi")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250770) | [Masterful Mettle](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250767), [Straight an' Narrow](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250768), [Powerful Puff-Puff Professional](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250769), and [Je Ne Sais Quoi](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250770) | Each character has a special skill category unique to them that isn't related to a weapon which unlocks special abilities and passive skills. This guide won't provide specific guidance on skill point distribution. Over the course of the game there was fairly even distribution between these skill categories and the weapons I selected to focus on for each character. Jessica's sex appeal and Hero's courage categories have very useful abilities such as monster charming and the Zap spell. Angelo's snigger/chuckle are also useful for some bosses to reduce their tension, though he tends to be more of the party healer, especially in the end game. I made heavy use of the [Spells and Skills guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/40285) on GameFAQs when I leveled up to determine the best way to distribute my points. |
| [![Yangus in battle stance with only his fists](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277812.png "Peerless Punch 'n' Punt Prodigy")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250771) | [Peerless Punch 'n' Punt Prodigy](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250771) | Before I started the game, I planned out the particular skills that I would max out to get all of these grind achievements. For this fisticuffs achievement, I decided that I wanted to give it to Jessica for her Magic Burst ability, which was very useful during the Dragovian Trials. Since I put all of my seeds of magic and wisdom into Jessica (that weren't used for alchemy recipes), her magic bursts were particularly powerful and resulted in amazing damage rolls especially at high tension. Of course, this is a very opinionated and subjective topic so feel free to put your skill points for fisticuffs into the character of your choice. Your timing on when to max it out can very as well. Perhaps you'll make this the very last skill point achievement to unlock? It's up to you! |
| [![Drawing of Hero brandishing a sword](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277494.png "Gainful Guv")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250772) [![Drawing of Yangus](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277495.png "Heavy Axe-cent")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250773) [![Drawing of Jessica](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277496.png "Martial Mage Master")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250774) [![Drawing of Angelo](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277497.png "Truly Tremendous Templar")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250775) | [Gainful Guv](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250772), [Heavy Axe-cent](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250773), [Martial Mage Master](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250774), and [Truly Tremendous Templar](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250775) | Pick weapons that you want to use for your characters based on the abilities that you'll want to use for the end game. Take time before you start playing to plan out what weapons that you want to invest in. Make use of the [Spells and Skills guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/40285) on GameFAQs when you are planning as well as when you level up. <br>My personal recommendations are axe for Yangus (Helm Splitter is a VERY useful skill), whip for Jessica, and bow for Angelo, primarily for boosting attack power with those weapons when I didn't want to do anything else but attack enemies during grinds. Hero is, unfortunately, locked in to using sword because of the [GigaGuv](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250776) achievement requirement, though that is entirely dependent on how much time and effort you want to put into getting seeds of skill and levels to invest in other weapons for Hero. I personally prefer the spear (Multithrust and Mercurial/Lightning Thrust are so good) so I did invest some there. <br>Again, this guide won't go into specific details on how to invest your skill points and the achievements allow for flexibility, so do what feels the most comfortable for you. My biggest advice is that not planning ahead **WILL** result in significant time investment later to grind for levels and seeds of skill. |
| [![Hero using the Gigagash ability](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277498.png "GigaGuv")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250776) | [GigaGuv](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250776) | Invest 100 skill points each in Hero's sword and courage skill categories. Easy, right? |
| [![Hero performing Dragon Soul attack](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277813.png "Birthrite")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250777) | [Birthrite](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250777) | You need to get Hero to level 65. That means metal slimes. Lots of them. |
| [![Jessica in a battle stance, brandishing her whip](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277543.png "Quadratic Cutthroat")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250802) [![A boomerang](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277544.png "Octagonist")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250803) | [Quadratic Cutthroat](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250802) and [Octagonist](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250803) | These will probably occur naturally over the course of your gameplay. If you are having trouble, Slime Hill could be a good place to encounter 8 regular slimes. Make use of spells that target groups or all enemies. A high level and high tensioned Jessica slinging Kacrackle or Kaboom could make this even easier in the late game, as long as the enemies don't run away. |
| [![Close up on Jessica's face as she performs the Puff-Puff ability](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277831.png "Puff-Puff Proof")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250804) | [Puff-Puff Proof](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250804) | A battle achievement that is RNG, requiring an enemy that can do Puff-Puff in combat to attempt it on Jessica. Probably the earliest instance where it could happen is the Witches near Red's place. |
| [![Close up of King Trode's cursed form face](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277832.png "Idly Breaking the Fourth Wall")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250805) | [Idly Breaking the Fourth Wall](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250805) | This achievement centers around the things King Trode will say when looking at the Battle Log (accessed with the Select button). Trode has priorities for saying certain messages and can block the desired speech that triggers this achievement. If he complains about having too much money, make sure you spend some to get it back down. If he wants you to tension more, go do some battles and purposely raise tension until he no longer says that message. For the achievement, you want to have **at least 20+ hours without having intimidated or flee battles too much**. Trode will potentially say the message after completing the Venus' Tear/retrieve Medea quest line. A signal that you are on the right track is if Trode calls the party the "Quartet of Questionable Quickness" while working on getting the Venus' Tear. I personally got it at 28+ hours thanks to a lot of time working on the guide's notes while leaving the wonderful overworld music playing in the background. Once this is done, you can then steadily work toward [Terrifying Trodanian](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250810) but avoid intimidating too much prior to this unlocking. <details><summary>The message that will unlock the achievement</summary>"I'm sure this doesn't apply to you, but leaving the console power on while you go wandering off to do other things is most uncouth! It gets quite hot in here, you know!"</details> |
| [![Hero in a purple aura with spiked up hair](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277545.png "Super Saiyan Squad")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250806) | [Super Saiyan Squad](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250806) | Have all characters reach max tension at some point in battles. It doesn't have to all be in one battle because the game tracks which characters have reached 100 tension. Characters can only reach 100 tension once some threshold is reached (some reports of a character reaching 50 about 10 times, or the party doing a cumulative 90 Psyche Up actions). You know that a character can go beyond 50 when the game does not say "xxxxx has reached a state of high tension" at 50 tension. The first time a character can hit 100 tension, it happens without fail. Subsequent times have only a 1/3 chances of success for any other character. |
| [![Hero looking at a map](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277546.png "Guv's Globetrotting")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250807) | [Guv's Globetrotting](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250807) | If you are grinding out your alchemy recipes, you will reach this milestone of 200 miles without any difficulty over the course of the normal gameplay. |
| [![Stone guardian monster](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277835.png "Combat Colossus")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250808) | [Combat Colossus](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250808) | Another achievement that you should easily reach over the course of normal gameplay. Just fight, not necessarily winning, 1000 battles. |
| [![A fire elemental](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277836.png "Fiend-Fighting Firebrand")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250809) | [Fiend-Fighting Firebrand](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250809) | The trend of naturally occurring milestones continue on here. Simply kill 2500 monsters. This will certainly take some time, but should be accomplished before the end of the normal game if you are fighting all encounters. |
| [![Hero yelling at the camera to intimidate the monsters](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277834.png "Terrifying Trodanian")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250810) | [Terrifying Trodanian](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250810) | The main thing to keep in mind with this is that you don't want to start work on this substantial threshold until after finishing [Idly Breaking the Fourth Wall](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250805). Intimidating 1000 monsters is a lot and is best saved for after saving the Dragovians. I noticed while working on this that attempts to intimidate monsters were failing on Slime Hill before Black Citadel. However, after finishing the first part of the postgame, intimidation never seemed to fail. I was also able to run on the first try every time. Maybe it was just luck, but I think the game is designed to remove this pain point when you are in the postgame. |
| [![Close up of the hell gladiator monster](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277833.png "Victoriously Vicious")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250811) | [Victoriously Vicious](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250811) | Unlike [Combat Colossus](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250808), you actually need to win 1000 battles. Again, this should occur naturally over the course of normal gameplay. |
| [![A gold golem monster](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277547.png "Tireless Terminator Tycoon")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250812) | [Tireless Terminator Tycoon](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250812) | Now THIS was an actual grind. By the time I finished the bestiary, other than the remaining Dragovian Trial bosses, I was just over three quarters of the way done... oof. Going to Neos and Whistling for gold golems is what I ended up doing and it didn't take very long to get the last 30k gold I needed. |
| [![Drawing of Yangus attacking with his weapon](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277837.png "Overkiller")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250813) | [Overkiller](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250813) | Perhaps you'll be able to unlock this near the end of the game, before the postgame. I was not able to get it until during a Dragovian Trial battle though. Since you have to fight a single enemy that will be able to take at least 3000 HP damage in one round, bosses are the primary means to reach this threshold. The trouble with bosses are their disruptive waves of ice. Timbrel of tension and psyche ups can be useful in raising tension quickly. Multiple hit skills or very high damage dealing spells and abilities with tension stacked by multiple characters are the ideal way to ensure you hit at least 3000 HP. <br>In my experience, I was able to unlock it with Jessica psyching up to 50 tension and using Magic Burst with a nearly max MP on one of the Dragovian Trial bosses. This skill could also work on any other enemy since you'll probably easily exceed 3000 HP. I was also able to hit over 3000 HP of damage by Hero doing over 2500 HP with Dragon Soul and the Dragovian King Sword while Yangus did another 500+ HP with a 50 tension attack in the same round against the Ultimate Dragon. |
| [![A variety of cheese items](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277549.png "For the Love of Cheese")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250814) | [For the Love of Cheese](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250814) | I'll spoil this here: this was my final achievement before getting the good ending achievement and mastery of the set. At first this seems like it would be a slog, but it actually isn't all that bad, especially with fast forward and going for this in the post game. You can buy fresh milk and rennet powder in the indoor bazaar in Argonia. Brew up a bunch of cheese in your instant alchemy pot. Whistle for encounters and use two cheeses. <br>It'll take at the most 50 encounters and 100 cheese. The reason I say "at the most" is because of a quirk of the game tracking the cheese use, if you use a cheese but the last enemy is defeated before the cheese is actually consumed, it still counts toward the measurement. A bug in the player's favor! Happy grinding! |
| [![A stone golem](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277811.png "Meatshield Mastery")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250815) | [Meatshield Mastery](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250815) | This achievement taught me to love to use my monster teams, as I hardly interacted with this system in my casual playthough on the 3DS. To even have the feature of summoning your monster team(s), you'll need to complete Rank E of the Monster Arena and unlocking the [Comrade Conjurer](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250781) achievement. Getting to 50 summons of the team will not take very long at all, despite the MP cost to do so. My primary team for most of the game, before going for any other arena ranks after Rank E was composed of Hackzilla, Hazel, and Goldman. When I came across an encounter that was relatively simple on the overworld, I would summon the monster team to handle it. Once I got into the later stages of the Monster Arena, I began to see the utility of teams with deathblows and abilities, and that was how I learned to love my monsters. |

If you are doing postgame content at all, you will be going here and taking advantage of the metal slimes that frequent this place. As stated above in the general guidance for grinding, this is best accomplished before completing Black Citadel since doing so afterword adds dark slimes and sabrecats into the encounter mix. You'll probably get tired of grinding, like I did, and complete the normal game before Hero reaches level 65. That's fine as you'll still unlock both of these achievements before that happens. Black Citadel at level 65 is certainly overkill too. So, when you are grinding metal slimes in the postgame, take advantage of running or intimidating non-metal battles and only fight at night, when metal slime family monsters appear more frequently. |

### Item Exchange

| [![Close up side profile of Dodgy Dave's masked face](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277541.png "Side Hustle")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250755) | [Side Hustle](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250755) | Dodgy Dave's alchemy item exchange is available immediately after getting Medea and the alchemy pot back. Dave will ask for items, the first being a special medicine. If you have been following along with the [100% walkthrough guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/43062) or at least doing your **ABCs** (Always Be Cooking), you'll probably have a special medicine by this point and can afford to cough one up to get Dave's reward as well as this achievement. The [100% walkthrough guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/43062) recommends waiting to continue to trade alchemy products to Dodgy Dave because you won't be able to complete all of the requests at this point in the game. I agree with this based on personal experience because I traded an item or two that I needed for later recipes and forgot and wondered where the missing ingredient was. Either note it in your personal [Alchemy Recipe Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ce8GHR2nSsI-ArWagsF2-yS-t5rjWYEyFdRzfKcDAE/edit?usp=sharing) if you continue to exchange now or wait until you can finish the rest of the requests in the postgame. |
| [![A very close up view of Dodgy Dave's masked face](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277542.png "Hustlin' Entrepreneur")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250756) | [Hustlin' Entrepreneur](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250756) | Trade in the remaining requested items until Dodgy Dave loops back to the beginning to pop the achievement. The [100% walkthrough guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/43062) has the details on what they want and the rewards you'll get. |
| [![Side profile of Princess Minnie's face](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277481.png "Medaling with Minnie's Mission")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250757) | [Medaling with Minnie's Mission](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250757) | This is awarded when turning in your first batch of mini-medals. You need 28 medals to get the first reward and, if you are following along with the [100% walkthrough guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/43062), you will have that by the time you have the ship and can go to Princess Minnie's castle for the first time. |
| [![Three gold bars](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277482.png "Transfer Tiny Trinkets, Get Golden Goods")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250758) | [Transfer Tiny Trinkets, Get Golden Goods](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250758) | The next target requires 52 mini-medals. As before, the [100% walkthrough guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/43062) identifies the moment that you should have this amount and when to turn it in to Minnie, usually timed with a new exploration option that allows for more treasure hunting. |
| [![Orichalcum item](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277483.png "Magnificent Metals from Miniature Medals")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250759) | [Magnificent Metals from Miniature Medals](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250759) | Now you need 83 mini-medals. The reward is arguably and has the potential to be the best of the bunch. |
| [![A flail](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277484.png "Fashionably Flailing for Finding Falderals")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250760) | [Fashionably Flailing for Finding Falderals](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250760) | The end is here after delivering 110 mini-medals. Congrats on earning your reward. Personally I find the achievement the better reward than the flail, but I don't have much experience with using that weapon since I prefer the axes for Yangus. |

### Monster Arena

I appreciate that this achievement set got me to engage with the Monster Arena and recruiting notorious monsters to form effective teams for combat. I didn't leverage this system in my 3DS version casual playthrough so I have a greater appreciation for what the monster teams can do for the game play now. In general, it is ideal to get the arena open as soon as you possibly can in the story and rank up as you progress rather than save it for the end. The [100% walkthrough guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/43062) has a call out for when they focused on getting the entire Monster Arena completed, but I got up through Rank D earlier than they did. It is up to you, ultimately, on when you use the arena's amenities. Nothing can be missed here, so engage with it as you desire.

By the end of the game and during the postgame, I had the following two teams:
- My Three Golems: Consists of Brickman, Goldman, and Stoneman. It is required for [Rocky Rumble: Red vs. Blue](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250130) but is also an excellent tank and damage dealing team whether they form up or not. It's also perfect for the opening rounds of the Dragovian Trial battles.
- The King and Us: Consists of Hev, Healer, and Curer. They typically open with using their Maximaster move, which revives all dead party members, fully healing the characters as well, and then Kabuff-ing the party while Kasap-ing the enemy party. They aren't much better beyond that other than that they are very evasive and can keep themselves healed up, but it may be better to just swap the character party back in right away to take advantage of the Kasap'd enemies.

Talk to him to receive the memos documenting the initial notorious monsters needed to be recruit to be able to enter the Monster Arena. Both the [100% walkthrough guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/43062) and the [map of notorious monster locations](https://www.woodus.com/den/gallery/graphics/dq8ps2/maps_overworld/infamous_monsters.webp) can help you find the monsters needed. You won't be able to complete this until you arrive at Trodain castle, where the notorious slime resides at the entrance. |
| [![Close up of Morrie's face with the letter F in the corner](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277506.png "Play With Yourself")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250780) | [Play With Yourself](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250780) | After making your initial monster team, it is good to swing by Farebury and pick up Hackzilla, the Axoraptor to the north of the town. Swap out the slime for Hackzilla. You should then be able to easily win Rank G and Rank F matches to get this achievement. Winning Rank F also causes more notorious monsters to appear in the overworld, allowing further progress in the arena and fighting more distinct notorious monsters as you wish. |
| [![Close up of Morrie's face with the letter E in the corner](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277501.png "Comrade Conjurer")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250781) | [Comrade Conjurer](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250781) | I added Scorpius and Hazel to my team with Hackzilla and won Rank E. Both are conveniently located near Red's Villa. Goldman is also an excellent monster over Scorpius, if desired, though that requires the ship so you can get to Neos. This allows you to start working on [Meatshield Mastery](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250815) too, so it is good to get this earlier on, perhaps after getting the ship or during Magic Key treasure cleanup. |
| [![Close up of Morrie's face with the letter D in the corner](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277502.png "Fresh Fiendly Friends")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250782) | [Fresh Fiendly Friends](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250782) | Completing Rank D in the Monster Arena adds even more notorious monsters to the overworld. This will allow even MORE progress in the distinct notorious monster achievements. This was a close match with Scorpius, Hazel, and Hackzilla, but they got it done. |
| [![Morrie's face with the letter B in the corner](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277503.png "Two Team Taskmaster")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250783) | [Two Team Taskmaster](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250783) | This is the point where I let the [100% walkthrough guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/43062) give me a hand in forming the best team to wrap up the arena achievements. Outside Orkutsk, you can get Roborg on the way to the town from Marta's cottage. I managed it with other monsters mentioned earlier but if you waited until now, Roborg could probably solo and get through Rank D. You can then get Cybot near Orkutsk and Talos near Neos. This team should be able to complete Ranks C and B. Rank B is the toughest in the game and there will be some luck involved. This will unlock the remaining notorious monsters in the world and well as having a second monster team. Talos becomes a key member of the final monster team that will wrap up the arena. |

Octurion will heal the team with Fullheal when needed (hopefully before dying...) and Skeledoid is very strong with two attacks per round with sleep touch. It was pretty much easy street for these final two challenges, though Rank S was scary close. I beat it with ~30 HP remaining on Octurion and the other monsters teammates defeated. <br>I love that S Rank has Torneko, as well as Ragnar with Healie in it! You can even chat with them after the fight if you win! |

### Treasure

In this section, I am only going to highlight the missable treasure achievements rather than discuss all of them, since there are plenty of other resources out there that already go into detail on this. The main thing to keep in mind is that a lot of the region treasure achievements will require revisits later, either with the magic key or ultimate key. So don't worry if you finish a scenario in a region and you don't have the associated treasure achievement unlocked yet.

One major note: **Don't forget that mimics COUNT** toward opening all treasure chests in a region or dungeon.

For convenience sake, here are the guides that are helpful in finding all of the treasures:
- [100% walkthrough guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/43062) on GameFAQs
- [Overworld treasures](https://www.woodus.com/den/gallery/graphics/dq8ps2/maps_overworld/tresure_chests.webp) on Dragon's Den
- [Cow locations](https://www.woodus.com/den/gallery/graphics/dq8ps2/maps_overworld/DQ8_Cows_Map.webp) on Dragon's Den

| Badge | Title | Strategy |

| [![World map zoomed in on Blizzard Peaks region with treasure chest in the corner](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277470.png "Superbly Stone Cold Treasure Tracker")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250728) | [Superbly Stone Cold Treasure Tracker](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250728) | This is notable because the location that has four missable treasures, Marta's cottage, is encountered about halfway through the region. However, you can't actually complete the region until you have received the ultimate key from Marta because of the locked area in the item shop in Arcadia. So, make absolutely sure that you have collected all four items in Marta's cottage prior to moving on to Orkutsk. Note that you do have to re-enter her cottage after your first visit there in order to check the barn for the mini-medal located within. |
| [![World map zoomed in on Neos with a treasure chest in the corner](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277472.png "Holy Hoarding, Hero!")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250730) | [Holy Hoarding, Hero!](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250730) | The biggest issue here is that Neos is destroyed when the Black Citadel is summoned. Any items in the town are no longer accessible after this point. Fortunately, you have PLENTY of opportunity to ensure that you have all of the items before that event occurs. <br>A common issue is the two birds that give you seeds on Savella island. Thankfully, the [Overworld treasures](https://www.woodus.com/den/gallery/graphics/dq8ps2/maps_overworld/tresure_chests.webp) map is great because it identifies their locations. <br>Don't forget that this also includes all other islands that are not named or even mapped. In particular, the unexplored island in the southwest corner of the map has a chest AND a mimic, both of which need to be opened. |
| [![Shattered emblem of Rhapthorne](https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/277523.png "Daringly Depriving the Darkness of Dreary Duds")](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250733) | [Daringly Depriving the Darkness of Dreary Duds](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250733) | The only real missable treasure is the map of the Black Citadel. Make sure you pick it up before completing the boss rush and escaping the citadel. You can find the map to the left of the entrance. All other treasures will appear on Neos if you didn't find them, but the map will not. |

## Notes for achievements while I play

<details>
<summary>DELETE ME!!!</summary>

This section is primarily for taking notes about certain achievements while I play the game so that I have info to go back to later as I work on the guide. These notes will be deleted later.

Each bullet starts with the achievement name being discussed, followed by a potential category to place it in, in bold text. For example, **Puff-Puff Proof (Battle)**, where **Battle** is the potential category that this achievement could be placed in.

### First 50% complete

- **Goo'd Faith (Side Quest)**: I did this as part of my first run through the dungeon before the boss challenge. This helps ensure that I don't miss this achievement by defeating the boss. However, you cannot leave the dungeon before completing this. If your health is getting to dangerous levels, it may be ideal to leave early and heal before having the first conversation with the slime before the Copper Sword chest. In my experience, I had two battles from the slime to the chest and back. If you can't survive those battles because health and resources are too low, leave without talking to the slime! Once you are ready, talk to the slime, say "yes", talk to the slime again, retrieve the sword from the chest, then return to the slime and talk again.

- **Fishticuffs (Challenge)**: I put some points into Fisticuffs on Yangus before attempting this, though that was probably not necessary. Maybe 3 points for the extra attack would be enough, especially since Yangus gets a decent amount of skill points at low levels, especially when compared to Hero. For this first boss challenge, which is a great stage setter for what is to come, I used two runs into the dungeon. First run was to clean out the treasures and gain some levels. I then left to heal back up and have a save prior to the second run to defeat the boss for the challenge. Once near the crystal ball, unequip weapons on Hero and Yangus. Now punch until it gives up! If you need to heal, have some medicinal herbs among the two characters for flexibility.

- **Salty Yarns, Fresh Salvation (Cutscene)**: Good strategy on the achievement forum thread. Enter Port Prospect and save. Talk to the man o' war in the well. Do the Khalamari boss fight (kill with Sizz if getting **Inkcinerated**). Return to the well and speak with the man o' war again to unlock it. If you are making liberal use of separate save files, especially before boss challenges, this should be easy to get, even with the very tight timing window. To be safe, I made sure to NOT speak with the man o' war until just before the Khalamari fight even with making early trips to Port Prospect while following along with the 100% walkthrough guide.

- **Inkcinerated (Challenge)**: I made sure to have a save before going to board the boat to fight the boss, especially with the tie to **Salty Yarns, Fresh Salvation**. Khalamari has 360 HP. I used a calculator to track boss HP totals as I did damage, and even used a couple of Sizz attacks to see what the average damage range is for the spell. To be safe, you could even use a Psyche Up or two when you get close, just to make sure. Or, you could make Yangus defend while Hero uses Sizz for a round or two if it is close but doesn't die. This isn't too difficult though and the save without a dungeon to runback makes this pretty trivial.

- **Basic Brazen Brewer (Lists)**: You got an alchemy pot! Thanks, King Trode! Now it is time to do your ABCs: Always Be Cooking! If you always have something in the pot, even repeated brewings of medicinal herbs, you will easily get the 30 brews completed before the improved alchemy pot is created.

- **If Your Torture's Incomplete, You Must Whip It (Challenge)**: This was probably my first *scary* boss challenge because I had a couple of close moments where characters nearly died. When Jessica whips the Tortured Soul, the measurement will count up showing how many you have done. While this is happening, Use Yangus and Hero as support. Attack the added monsters as appropriate while also using healing items or Hero's Heal spell. Jessica obviously cannot be allowed to die before the 10 whips (and death of any characters should be avoided anyway). If you are concerned about levels, the dungeon has opportunities to get your first metal slime, which could incentivize you to grind a little bit. As with other boss challenges, it is wise to make this in at least two trips through the dungeon, especially at these lower levels. Clean out the dungeon of treasure while also fighting to increase levels. Leave and heal/save. Return and attempt to fight the boss. If it doesn't go well, reload the save and get some more levels. Good luck!

- **Two Traumas (Cutscene)**: Sleep in the Riverside Chapel's inn on the way to Ascantha. This is missable because progressing too far into the story will block this scene from occurring. So, make sure you rest! If you are collecting treasures in the area while making the trip to Ascantha, you will be certainly be making use of this inn anyway.

- **Silence Rings Wisdom (Cutscene)**: There was some talk about this being potentially missable but I don't believe it is. The unfortunate thing about this is that there isn't much hint about who wants to see the Lady's Ring that I was able to find from talking to NPCs. You are supposed to just know/remember from earlier conversation that the short rich guy standing outside the right side of the Farebury church is the person who lost the ring in Ascantha. The person in question also migrates to the inn's second floor at night. Concerning the potential for this being missable, someone stated that the man leaves Farebury after the party gets the ship. So, once you have retrieved the ring from Ascantha's well, go Zoom directly to Farebury and talk to the man to complete the quest.

- **Fortuitousless (Cutscene)**: I initially missed this one because I spoke with Trode in the Pickham bar to have Medea stolen without talking to the fortune teller first. Thankfully, I used multiple saves and was able to reload to get this achievement specifically before reloading the later save to progress further. The reason this happened is because the fortune teller was not in their tent at night which was when I was exploring the town. So, make sure you rest to get to day time if it is night before stopping inside the fortune teller's tent. Lesson learned and reinforced: MAKE MULTIPLE SAVES!!

- **Puff-Puff Proof (Combat/Grind)**: A battle achievement that is RNG, requiring an enemy that can do Puff-Puff in combat to attempt it on Jessica. Probably the earliest instance where it could happen is the Witches near Red's place.

- **Lovelorn Looter (Challenge)**: The right statue plaque by the boss will restore your HP. It may be ideal to take a couple of trips into the dungeon: one to get all of the treasure, then leave and save, and then return again to actually do the boss challenge. Some people have mentioned grinding to get Jessica the Oomph spell unlocked, which she earns at Level 19. I am attempting it without Oomph unlocked, instead using Kasap to lower the boss' defense, Acceleratle for speed buffs, and Kabuff for defense buffs. My levels are 20, 20, 18, 18. Boss has 1100HP... Doing about 110 HP of damage every attack with max tension. Single tension buff doing 75-ish HP damage. Doing 40-ish HP damage with normal attacks. Kasap's not landing. Need to stay above 85-ish HP to ensure desperation attack doesn't one-shot a character. Okay! I did it first try! Just heal with Angelo and Hero, Yangus attacks, and Jessica defends. Raising tension wasn't worth it because Yangus kept getting put to sleep when near or at max tension. Raising defense with Kabuff worked for a bit but wore off and just defending was good enough while having Angelo or Hero heal when HP got too low or a desperation attack was done.

- **Idly Breaking the Fourth Wall (Cutscene)**: Centers around the things King Trode will say when looking at the Battle Log (accessed with the Select button). Trode has priorities for saying certain messages and can block the desired speech that triggers this achievement. If he complains about having too much money, make sure you spend some to get it back down. If he wants you to tension more, go do some battles and purposely raise tension until he no longer says that message. The idea, according to the messages on the achievement, is that you want to have a large amount of hours (at least 20+ hours) without having intimidated or flee battles too much. It looks like Trode will potentially say the message after completing the Venus' Tear/retrieve Medea quest line. Perhaps we know we are on the right track if Trode calls the party the "Quartet of Questionable Quickness" when working on getting the Venus' Tear/saving Medea. GOT IT! The message is "I'm sure this doesn't apply to you, but leaving the console power on while you go wandering off to do other things is most uncouth! It gets quite hot in here, you know!" I got it at 28+ hours (lots of time cranked up working on the guide while leaving the wonderful overworld music playing in the background). Once this is done, you can then steadily work toward **Terrifying Trodian**.

- **Side Hustle (Item Exchange)**: Should get this right after getting Medea back and talking to Dodgy Dave, who wants a special medicine, if you are working hard at getting all the alchemy recipes as you go, via the [100% walkthrough guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/43062).

- **Stewing Stalwart (Lists)**: Cooking 100 items in the improved alchemy pot seems like a lot, but if you are doing your ABCs (Always Be Cooking), then this should come with ease. Missable because getting the final upgrade in the postgame will lock this achievement out. But since the time between getting the improved pot after saving Medea and the postgame unlock of the instant pot is a VERY long time, this shouldn't be an issue if you are persistent in getting new recipes unlocked _and_ cooking repeats.

- **Ragazzo! (Monster Arena)**: You should unlock the monster arena as soon as you arrive at Trodain Castle. After capturing Smiles the slime, enter the castle, zoom to Morrie's Arena, and talk to him to enter inside. Talk to him one more time to name your team, get the key, and be allowed to capture notorious monsters. This will also enable you to actually get the remaining Monster Arena achievements, with suitable team members. This will also allow you to start work on the **Meatshield Mastery** achievement by summoning your team 50 times.

- **Peerless Protector (Full Game?)** and **Hoarder Hero (Full Game?)**: These two unlock on completion of the normal ending of the game. You are always reminded of them since the primed indicator is always in the bottom right corner by default. If one turns off, load a save. You don't want to sell anything anyway because you will also be going for **I Did 'Em Alchemyself** which will need a ton of items to complete.

- **Enduring Endearment (Side Quest)**: This one is huge, as it requires persistence in observing 24 optional scenes after specific events occur throughout the second half of the normal game. It looks like the events start before Charmles is escorted. There will be an initial scene. Once that happens, you can see two more scenes. You will know that you are tapped out on scenes when, if you drink from the spring, you'll have a "stolen moment" with Medea.
    - After getting **Provisory Princess**, have another drink from the spring to heal yourself and allow Medea to drink as well. She'll state that she's too full and needs to walk around before drinking again. Leave and re-enter the spring and the first measurement for this achievement will appear. She still won't drink, but progress has started!
    - I was able to do scene 2 after wandering and unlocking Zoom spots at the desert chapel and Argonia. I probably could have unlocked earlier. I don't know what the minimum distance traveled is needed yet. I could not do scene 3 right away because I needed to travel more again. I think it is a function of time AND distance. I can't seem to trigger Medea being able to drink again just by increasing one or the other. Also, sleeping in an inn does not work either. I seem to be able to get her to drink again if I use treasure hunting as a time and distance filler. Another option was to Zoom to Farebury, use Holy Protection, and then run around in fast forward outside of town to pass time and distance. Would walking in a city also work? Like when trying to grind out steps for alchemy? No. I confirmed that walking in cities does NOT work. You CAN do this at Hilltop Hut though! No enemies in the courtyard outside the hut!
    - Here are the points where you need to have 3 scenes before moving onto the next one:
        - Before Argonia, escorting Charmles and getting the magic mirror [1-3]
        - Before end of Dark Ruins. You are conveniently directed here after getting the mirror so get all of the scenes before charging the mirror up and returning to the ruins. You will get scene 4 when you sleep before going to the spring, which also gets you the **Royal Reverie** achievement. [4-6]
        - Before end of Arcadia scenario. Got the dream (scene 7) sleeping at the inn in Arcadia after traveling there for the first time. [7-9]
        - Before end of Marta's scenario. Got the dream (scene 10) sleeping at the inn in Arcadia after having defeated Evil Jessica and mourning the death of another great sage. [10-12]
        - Before end of the Godbird scenario. Got the dream (scene 13) sleeping at the inn in Argonia while opening ultimate key locked doors. Certainly any inn will work but this is when it occurred to me that I should use an inn to get this next sequence going. [13-15]
        - Before end of Sir Leopold's scenario. Got the dream (scene 16) sleeping at the Hilltop Hut inn after defeating Gemon and getting the soulstone. [16-18]
        - Before Neos scenario. Since you can start the Neos scenario right after Purgatory island, it is imperative that you rest at an inn for the dream (scene 19) and then get the two spring segments right away. The window for this one is short! [19-21]
        - After Neos scenario. Sure enough, after the Black Citadel flies off, another inn rest will start the final dream (scene 22). Nearly there! [22-24]

- **Provisory Princess (Side Quest)**: Is this where the scene that triggers the beginning of the optional scenes for **Enduring Endearment**??? Big, if true! It does seem to be before Charmles' escort mission that the big achievement is tied to. Unfortunately, no. After the cutscene that unlocks this achievement, you will need to leave the spring for a while before Medea will drink again. However, leaving the spring and reentering right away will work!

- **Awesome Alexandrian Half-Inching Hero (Lists)**: If you are missing only one by the time you get the Magic Key, then it is probably the magic key locked chest behind Hilltop Hut in the Trodain region. It was noted by TheMysticalOne that they included the wasteland chests in the Alexandria region for this achievement though the game considers this region part of Trodain. They mentioned that they may update the achievement back in November 2022 but that change hasn't happened yet, so it probably never will.

- **Terrifying Trodian (Grind)**: Only start working on this after getting the Venus' Tear and unlocking **Idly Breaking the Fourth Wall**. A perfect time to grind out some enemy intimidation is when doing treasure chest clean up after getting new keys/vehicles or after events. Note that this is 1000 monsters scared away, not 1000 battles, like I initially thought when I first saw this achievement. 😅 I did some more grinding on this achievement during the post game while going after metal slimes on Slime Hill. Slimes weren't intimidated by me prior to the normal game ending. Maybe it was just having higher levels after making it to the Dragovian sanctuary and the first defeat of the Lord of the Dragovians that affected it though...

- **Play With Yourself (Monster Arena)**: After making your initial monster team, it is good to swing by Farebury and pick up Hackzilla, the Axoraptor to the north of the town. Swap out the slime for Hackzilla. You should then be able to easily win Rank G and Rank F matches to get this achievement. Winning Rank F also causes more notorious monsters to appear in the overworld, allowing further progress in several distinct notorious monster achievements.

- **Comrade Conjurer (Monster Arena)**: I added Scorpius and Hazel to my team with Hackzilla and won Rank E. This allows you to start working on **Meatshield Mastery** too, so it is good to get this earlier on, perhaps after getting the ship or during Magic Key treasure cleanup.

- **Brotherhood Bullying (Cutscene)**, **Just Cheese, Cheese, Cheese (Cutscene)**, **Lovely Litter (Lists)**, and **COR BLIMEY!!!!(#4) (Cutscene)**: Do these right after you get the ship!

- **COR BLIMEY!!!!!(#5) (Cutscene)**: This can be missed if you don't go into the theater before doing the Baccarat part of the story. If the Casino is open again and you hadn't done this, it'll be missed. So, go to the Inn to hear the conversation between the bartender and Golding's bodyguard then go back to the theater basement and talk to the bartender again.

- **Dedicated Dairy Dude Determinedly Discharges Duty (Lists)**: Make a table of cow locations and when they are accessible (based on story achievement?). Provide link to the map as well: https://www.woodus.com/den/gallery/graphics/dq8ps2/maps_overworld/DQ8_Cows_Map.webp

- **Fresh Fiendly Friends (Monster Arena)**: Completing Rank D in the Monster Arena adds even more notorious monsters to the overworld. This will allow even MORE progress in the distinct notorious monster achievements.

- **COR BLIMEY! Party Chat Edition (Cutscene)**: Seems to be a small window to get this. After getting lost in Dark Ruins and told to go to Argonia, must enter party chat once in town but **BEFORE** going into the castle! I even missed this initially, but thankfully kept a save just before going into the castle that I was able to use to reload and get the scene.

- **Dhoulmagus Defeated Despite Having Haphazard Healing (Challenge)**: This is notable because it's the only boss challenge with a level requirement in that you must defeat both forms of the boss back-to-back without having Multiheal, Omniheal, or Hustle Dance. Hustle Dance is the Sex Appeal 100 skill point reward so it is unlikely that this is an issue unless the player is ALL IN on that category (which is not a good idea anyway). Omniheal is a Hero only spell that is the Courage 82 skill point reward, so that is also unlikely to be unlocked without grinding. Multiheal is the one that must be avoided by ensuring **Angelo does not exceed level 30** before or during the boss fights. When I saw the requirements for this achievement, I was at level 24 on Angelo after having gone to the Dark Ruins and needing to go to Argonia to get the mirror, so I think I am in a good position to not exceed level 30 by the end of the battles... As for the "back-to-back" portion, dying to the second form allows you to refight the second form only, which locks you out of this achievement. Fortunately, if you are going for **Peerless Protector** anyway, this won't be a problem. Just make sure you save before the boss fight. Ideally, as with other dungeons with boss challenge achievements, go through the Dark Ruins to clear out the treasure, Evac and save, then return to fight the boss.
    - Good to know: The achievement is awarded before the experience points from the second battle. So, Angelo can be just at level 29 going into the fight and as long as he doesn't level up in the first phase, this should be no problem.
    - I had some difficulty initially because my levels were a bit lower (29/29/27/27). I did some grinding at the pool just before the door to the boss until Angelo hit level 29. The battle went much better. Having magic waters was very helpful as well, since Hero and Angelo were very focused on healing with Mid- and Fullheal.

- **Arg! Almost as Annoying as Charmles (Lists)**: There are four treasures that don't appear in Argonia until after the Neos events near the end of the game. There are later achievements in the set that drive us to return here later though. A new dungeon appears in the region (via the Chancellor's mirror) with two chests and two new items spawn in the building next the castle, where the bazaar moved into. So, you should be at 54 out of 58 treasures found before the Black Citadel appears. If you aren't, make sure you didn't miss anything!

- **Holy Hoarding, Hero! (Lists)**: The Savella Cathedral Island has two tiny birds that will run up to you and give you seeds, which count toward this achievement. Make sure to grab them! Both are on the western side trail of the island: one at the northern most end of the trail and the other midway between the southern end of the trail and the fork leading toward the cathedral. These birds are identified in the [overworld treasure map](https://www.woodus.com/den/gallery/graphics/dq8ps2/maps_overworld/tresure_chests.webp), if you need help. This can only be completed after you can fly up to the Lord High Priest's residence. Also of note, all treasure chest achievements include any mimic chests in a given region. For example, the unexplored island in the lower left corner of the map has a mimic and must be opened and fought to get all chests for this achievement.

- **Condescending Crusader (Cutscene)**: Another missable cutscene involving Marcello and Angelo. Apparently this is available at the same time as the one in Neos, once you have the ship. It is missable by getting too far along into the story though. I grabbed it after having gone to the Dark Ruins and before heading to Argonia.

- **Magic Must Meet Magic (Challenge)**: Having Hero with Zap and a Ring of Awakening is very helpful. Bounce to prevent Kasnooze landing could help too. Yangus holding the Cheiron's Bow from Rydon Tower can help with maintaining health, since Yangus can't do much else. Hero without Zap will make this very slow though. However, if you are working on maxing Courage for **Masterful Mettle** (and you should), you'd probably have Zap unlocked by this point anyway.

- **COR BLIMEY!!!!!!!!(#8) (Cutscene)**: Choose to kill Jessica. Yikes... Does this happen directly after the fight with Evil Jessica? Yes! Dominico asks you if you would have the honour of finishing her off. Say yes and Trode will run in and... COR BLIMEY!

- **Super Saiyan Squad (Combat/Grind)**: All characters reach max tension at some point in battles. It doesn't have to all be in one battle because the game tracks which characters have reached 100 tension. Characters can only reach 100 tension once something happens though I haven't found anything definitive on what that trigger is (some reports of a character reaching 50 about 10 times, or the party doing a cumulative 90 Psyche Up actions). You know that a character can go beyond 50 when the game does not say "xxxxx has reached a state of high tension" at 50 tension. The first time a character can hit 100 tension, it happens without fail. Subsequent times have only a 1/3 chances of success for any other character.

- **Cor Blimey.(#9) (Cutscene)**: After leaving Marta's cottage and re-entering to get the mini-medal from the barn, head around back to the nook grass herb garden to get this cutscene and achievement.

- **Two Team Taskmaster (Monster Arena)**: A good time to tackle this is after reaching Orkutsk. You can get Roborg on the way to the town and this killer machine can clean up the first four ranks solo really. I managed it with other monsters mentioned earlier but if you waited until now, then get Roborg and get through Rank D. You can then get Cybot near Orkutsk and Talos near Neos. This team should be able to complete Ranks C and B. Rank B is the toughest in the game and there will be some luck involved. This will unlock the remaining notorious monsters in the world and well as having a second monster team.

- **Champion Challenger (Monster Arena)** and **Morrie's Magnifico Monster Master (Monster Arena)**: With Rank B done, grabbing Octurion from the beach south of Argonia and Skeledoid from the Dark Ruins will make a fantastic team with Talos. Octurion will heal the team with Fullheal when needed (hopefully before dying...) and Skeledoid is very strong with two attacks per round with sleep touch. Pretty much easy street for these final two challenges. I love that S Rank has Torneko, as well as Ragnar with Healie in it! You can even chat with them after the fight if you win! I definitely got really lucky on the final Rank S battle... I beat it with ~30 HP remaining on Octurion and the other monsters defeated. Very close!

### Last 50% notes

- **Compassionate Champion (Cutscene/Side Quest)**, **Fiendish Friends to the End (Challenge)**, and **First Rate Reconciler (Cutscene? Maybe I should make a Side Quest category?)**: These missables are notable because they aren't started in your first visit to Baccarat, but after the events in Arcadia. I went here after meeting Marta and going to Orkutsk. Is Baccarat's Casino unlocking considered optional? Yes! The siblings solve the problem on their own if you progress too far into the story (looks to be the Marcello fight/Neos event).
    - For **Compassionate Champion**, there are 3 bodyguards. The priest is the first found, on a path off the main route in the second area. The magic user bodyguard is on the main route in the third area. The last one, the warrior, is on the main route laying down on the floor losing consciousness and must be spoken with twice (the measurement for the achievement says there are 4 events to meet the requirement). Someone also mentioned that this wasn't unlocking even though the measurement was at 4/4 but then they unlocked it the following day so it's probably linked to something else that must be done as well as talking to the bodyguards.
    - For **Fiendish Friends to the End**, I manually tracked the health of the bosses. Red Horn has 3100 HP and Blue Fang has 2630 HP. I ended up messing up the first time because I missed the damage Hero did to Red Horn when trying to equalize their HP and made an estimate that must have been too low because I inadvertently killed Red and couldn't kill Blue in the same round. Second attempt was a success. I used Psyche Up with Hero, Yangus, and Jessica to 50, and used Hero and Yangus to do physical damage to each of the bosses (they both do equivalent damage of approximately 400 HP) while Jessica did Kacrackle to do ~400HP to both simultaneously. Near the beginning of my second attempt, Red Horn tensioned up to 50, so I put in the monster team that won Rank S and they teamed up on Red Horn to knock them down to 374 HP. Once my party tagged back in, we focused on Blue Fang. Then, while Jessica tensioned, I chipped them both to the mid 200s in HP. Unfortunately, Jessica died so while Angelo revived her, I tensioned Hero and Yangus to 50, didn't get knocked over by Blue, and so they both did 400+ HP to each boss in the same round, unlocking the achievement. The forum for this achievement mentioned using Shining Shot with Angelo, but I hadn't unlocked that skill yet (88 SP on the Bow category). They were able to do 900+ damage while tensioned.

- **Platinum Protection Plan (Lists)**, **Fast as a Falcon (Lists)**, and **Gorgeous Gringham Gal (Lists)**: It is ideal to wait until Baccarat's casino is reopened before working toward getting these. This is because Roulette is probably the most efficient way to gain tokens (aside from outright purchasing them). If you can at least get 22000 tokens, you can cover the first third of the board. This includes 0-9 and all of the spots between them, the positions between 7-9 and 10-12, as well as the arrow that covers the 1-9 region. If the ball lands on 1-9, you will gain 52500-66500 tokens depending on where it lands, which is a considerable gain. I haven't landed on 0 so I don't know what the payout is there (I'm sure I could math it out, but... eh...). While you can earn just enough to get the three items needed for achievements, you will need more tokens in order to get alchemy recipe ingredients as well. Using the [100% Walkthrough guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/43062), I needed 502,000 tokens for everything it recommends, which won't take long with saves/resets. The guide also provides pointers for getting to the 22000 tokens amount that will make roulette much less painful since money is probably tight anyway without being able to sell for **Hoarder Hero**. Happy gambling! ![Roulette table with 22000 tokens on all available spaces from 0-9, with the number 7 highlighted for winning. A caption states "Congratulations! You won 52500 tokens!"](win-roulette.png)

- **Hellhound Harrier (Combat/not a boss challenge per se)**: There are four fights that are required. Hellhounds are located inside the house as soon as you enter, each room in the cellar, and then outside the cave after the events inside. There is no measurement notification for this one. It is also your last chance to get the four items that can be found in Marta's cottage (needed for **Superbly Stone Cold Treasure Tracker**) and barn so make sure you check with Nose for Treasure to confirm!

- **Soft and Squishy (Cutscene)**: I went to Le Club Puff-Puff during the ultimate key treasure clean up and picked up the achievement then. You need the ultimate key to enter anyway so this is a perfect time to get the achievement while getting the treasures in the changing room.

- **Superbly Stone Cold Treasure Tracker (Lists)**: This can't be completed until after getting the ultimate key and getting the treasures in the item shop in Arcadia. However, it is missable because of the events at Marta's Cottage causing the four items there to be lost if you didn't get them before the major storyline event.

- **Supreme Swashbuckling (Challenge)**: I only attacked with Hero and use Angelo to reduce Crow's tension when needed and support healing. I also put a Cheiron's Bow and Rune Staff on Yangus to do backup healing and raise team defense. Jessica should Sap, Oomph, and Acceleratle. Hero's Psyche Ups were only to 20 most of the time because Crow would wave of ice too often. I was able to get to 50 on occasion when I felt the turn order was appropriate.

- **COR BLIMEY!!!!!!!!!(#9 actual) (Cutscene)**: There is a person on the left side of Empycchu next to two horses. They will ask you if you want to trade Medea for them. Say yes for a hilarious COR BLIMEY!

- **Bruising Big Bird (Challenge)**: Not much to say about this one. Just don't use attack spells. I had Hero focus on big healing, Yangus do Psyche Ups to 20 tension then attack, Jessica Oomph Yangus before his attacks and support with Hip Drops or other physical attacks, and Angelo Kabuffing and Multihealing between waves of ice. Empyrea did a LOT of waves of ice, much more than Captain Crow, so I had to keep tensioning at 20 rather than try to get to 50. Consider support healing with Cheiron's Bow and Kabuffs with the Rune Staff also, if concerned about MP.

- **Gemonstratable Superiority (Challenge)**: Gemon has 3960 HP, meaning that at least 2000 HP damage must be done with four attacks greater than 500 HP. The wiggle room of 1960 HP should be enough to experiment to see what damage numbers you can get without going too high or too low so that you can adjust your strategy during the course of the battle. Of course, it is recommended that if you don't want to repeat getting all of the treasures in the Eyrie that you leave and save before making another run through the dungeon to fight the boss. Thankfully, Gemon does not have wave of ice, but does summon dark turkeys which can knock characters over with their intimidating scream, causing a loss of tension. In my setup, Yangus was the primary damage dealer with tension at 50, Oomphed, wielding a Bardiche of Binding at level 35, and Gemon sapped once, doing 540-580 HP at a time. Other party members supported with Kabuffs, Insulatle, Acceleratle, and multihealing with the spell or Cheiron's Bow. Hero and Jessica also helped to eliminate additional monsters, prioritizing dark turkeys. Insulatle didn't seem to be too big a factor in the battle. Sap is a HUGE priority to ensure that Yangus' damage will exceed 500+ HP when at 50 tension. If Gemon's defense returns to normal and their Bounce is not active, reapply Sap immediately. After getting four rounds greater than 500+ HP damage, I let Sap lapse on Gemon to see what Yangus' damage would be. At 50 tension, I got only ~450 HP damage on them. So Sap is very important. Of course, party compositions vary so things can be different for others. Thankfully, this battle isn't too demanding and difficult to maintain health in so you have time to experiment and ensure that you can do the necessary damage.

- **Showing Shade on the Forefront (Cutscene)**: After having Godbird access, head to the Lord High Priest's residence right away? Yes! Land on the island and try to open the gate into the residence and the cutscene will play out.

- **Herbal Handout (Lists)**: Tell Marek "yes" to receive the four bits of nook grass. You can do this as soon as you have the Godbird's soulstone. I picked it up when doing treasure chest cleanup with Godbird and getting the next set of scenes with Medea before heading to Tryan Gully.

- **The Heights of Hoarding (Lists)**: You can get this as soon as you have the soulstone. In fact, it's the ideal time to do so, as you should go around doing treasure clean up when you get it (after seeing the **Showing Shade on the Forefront** cutscene, of course).

- **Shaken Drink, Stirring Tale (Cutscene)**: As soon as you enter Tryan Gully, proceed to the pub as King Trode and talk to the bartender to get this cutscene. This isn't marked as missable. Is King Trode always the party lead when in Tryan Gully? Even after getting the Darktree Leaf?

- **Darkness Detector (Lists)** and **You Sure Can Pickham (Lists)**: If you are following the 100% Walkthrough guide, you should get both of these around the same time. If you are missing anything, make sure to check the overworld for two chests, especially the one around the outside of Tryan Gully to the east over the bridge.

- **Deliciously Cheesy Win (Challenge)**: The last hit must be with an attack cheese. Remember that only two cheeses can be used per battle. Evil Sir Leopold has 4260 HP. Track damage and make sure you use the cheese as the final attack. In my experience, I overshot it once with a 20 tension Yangus that had Oomph in effect. The second time around, I had chipped damage down once Leopold was at 500 HP or so and got them down to 19 HP remaining. I had a plain cheese and super spicy cheese on me. The plain cheese only did 9 HP of damage... Only 10 HP remained. The super spicy cheese did 77 HP of damage.

- **Hermano a Hermano (Challenge)**: Marcello's use of wave of ice seems very random, making it tough to keep Angelo's tension up. I resorted to going only to 20 tension then attacking mostly, though I would get interrupted a lot. It could have been that I was just unlucky as well. I did manage to get up to 50 tension a couple of times too. Your mileage may vary. Jessica should definitely Sap once or twice. Hero is the healer this time since Angelo is busy. Yangus will do nothing unless you have some support items like Cheiron's Bow and Rune Staff.

- **Final Fortune (Cutscene)**: I was able to get this as soon as the Black Citadel went into the air. While doing treasure clean up and the final scenes for **Enduring Endearment**, I went to Farebury to talk to Kalderasha not expecting this to pop then. I had figured that this achievement was for a scene after completing the Black Citadel. So, you might as well get it knocked out during the final treasure clean up before the end of the game.

- **Savoring the Squidly Silence (Cutscene)**: Defeat the king squid that has shown up outside of the casino in Baccarat, refuse the first offer of 200 casino tokens, then accept the offer of 400 casino tokens. Easy!

- **Cook Cooker (Challenge)**: These are just a pair of slightly higher HP Boss Trolls. All I did was tension up to 50 on Hero and Jessica and cast Kasizzle while Yangus and Angelo both supported with Kabuffs and Multiheal with spells and items. Two casts of Kasizzle from both casters killed the trolls in the same round.

- **Daringly Depriving the Darkness of Dreary Duds (Lists)**: The only real missable treasure is the map of the Black Citadel. Make sure you pick it up before completing the boss rush and escaping the citadel. You can find the map to the left of the entrance. All other treasures will appear on Neos if you didn't find them, but the map will not.

- **Smiting Satan (Challenge)**: Tensioning to 100 is a 1/3 chance, but this is further complicated by Rhapthorne doing waves of ice... Can we get timbrel of tension at this stage of the game? Yes we can! Make a sun crown from the skull helm found on the Isolated Plateau (accessed with the Godbird) and some saint's ashes, then cook the sun crown with a tough guy tattoo and magic beast hide. Should probably make this as soon as possible anyway... With the timbrel, tension to 100 is guaranteed. I managed to luck out and get the 100 tension and then an attack on the following round within the first three rounds of combat. Round 1 I psyched up Hero and used the timbrel with Jessica. Round 2 I psyched up again and used timbrel, but Jessica went first. Thankfully Hero did hit 100 tension. Round 3 I hit Rhapthorne with an attack and primed the achievement to unlock once the battle is completed.

- **Marble Match Mayhem (Challenge)**: At the start of the battle, the achievement is primed. Ensure that each character targets only their own statue. Since my Jessica only had a whip in their inventory, I had her use the timbrel of tension every round until the other characters destroyed their own statues. There shouldn't be risk of targeting another statue if the character destroys their own and then defends in the following round. The nice thing about this strategy is that Jessica is getting her tension up to 50 or 100 before attacking her statue. I used Kafrizzle and did over 700 HP damage in one shot. Here are the HP values for each statue:
    - Hero: 545 HP
    - Yangus: 505 HP
    - Jessica: 385 HP
    - Angelo: 467 HP

- **Rocky Rumble: Red vs. Blue (Challenge)**: Some preparation is in order before heading to the Black Citadel. You will need a monster team consisting of Golems only: Brickman (from Maella region), Goldman (from Neos), and Stoneman (from Dark Ruins heights). Definitely complete the monster arena fully so that you have two teams and maximum number of monsters that you can add to your reserves. A tricky part of all of this is that this is the final part of a boss rush after defeating Rhapthorne. The Golems fusing together into Mazin is RNG and they have to be the one who defeats Ruin. The Golem team will have four rounds so you don't want Ruin's health to be too low that they defeat him without fusing, nor be too high so that Mazin can't kill Ruin either. If they can't win the battle, you have a LONG runback to try again. Fortunately, any boss challenges completed prior to this one can be ignored in the runback which can potentially alleviate some pain points. If this is the sticking point for completing Black Citadel, it may be a good idea to grind some levels at Slime Hill to make the runback quicker... Ruin has 3800 HP. My first attempt was a failure because I forgot to track the HP and my estimations were way off. I ended up having to do a runback which went decently quickly because my levels were already high from grinding metal slimes on Slime Hill for their achievements prior to Black Citadel. In my second attempt, I took down Ruin to around 1000 HP (I ended up somewhere around 950+ HP) and then called in my Golem team. I was fortunate that they decided to fuse into Mazin on the first round. They then did a normal attack for 311 HP damage on round 2 and went for, and landed, a desperation attack on round 3 for 900+ HP damage, killing Ruin and unlocking the achievement!
    - This capstone for the boss rush in the Black Citadel evacuation really is intense because of all of the lost time risk that mounts up. It is especially scary with the RNG reliance on the monster team to do what is needed. Very tough!

- **Savvy Sage Summoner (Challenge)**: Missable because shield is permanently destroyed. If you die after destroying the shield and then save, you will lose this achievement because the fight starts at the second phase. If you are going for **Peerless Protector**, this shouldn't be an issue though. If you die on second phase, reset and try again. Since this unlocks as soon as you break the shield if you did it within 14 turns, if for some reason you exceeded the number of turns, just reset and try again. If you are having problems, gain some levels to be able to resist the spells and physical damage enough to be able to heal fully at least every other round or two. Worst case, if you can't get this within 14 rounds, you definitely will when you do it again for the good ending.

- **Efficient Evil Eliminator (Challenge)**: Not missable since this boss can be fought again in the post game. If you can't get it within 20 rounds, you will after completing the post game dungeon and trials. Timbrel of tension will pay dividends for dealing out damage and keeping health up. Good luck! 

- **Smelterweight (Combat/Grind)** and **Oxidizer (Combat/Grind)**: Howlwind Hill (sometimes referred to as Slime Hill) is the place to be, located just north of Rydon's Tower where some chests are that can only be accessed via the Godbird's soulstone. All slime enemies are here, including metal slime variants. Just stay in one spot, Whistle for an encounter, and fight! Lightning Thrust and Executioner are your friend. This will also go well with the grind achievements for maxing out skills! I **HIGHLY** recommend doing this before completing the Black Citadel because after that, dark sabrecats will also appear here, which can slow down the amount of metal slimes that will make an appearance... Prior to the Black Citadel, metal slimes seem to appear frequently at all times. After Black Citadel, they only really seem to appear most at night. In other news, I seem like I am able to intimidate more enemies on Slime Hill during the postgame so I built up my intimidate counter here too. I did check out the unexplored island and found the liquid metal slime appearance rate to be too little compared to Slime Hill. Getting the Metal King Boomerang can help with the regular metal slime groups that show up on the hill too. I was able to take down a 6 out of 9 metal slimes using that boomerang along with Executioner and Angelo with a metal king sword.
    - I am a big fan of seeing this encounter which seemed to show up a decent amount during my time on Slime Hill before the Black Citadel:
![An enemy encounter consisting of a Metal King Slime flanked by three Liquid Metal Slimes on both sides](./favorite-encounter.png)

- **Heavy-Handed Healer Hero (Challenge)**: Post game boss challenge time! Kabuff with Yangus' rune staff and Angelo's spell. Multiheal with Yangus' sage's stone and Angelo's spell. Jessica should timbrel of tension and Sap the boss. Hero will Psyche Up and then stabby stab with Multithrust or other powerful technique. WAIT?!!! Timbrel of Tension is not guaranteed to raise to 100 tension?!! WHAT THE FUCK?! <!--TODO: I need to update the notes to reflect that it can fail to raise to 100. I verified that it can in fact fail to raise to 100 tension.-->

- **Tragic Togetherness (Cutscene)**: I didn't know about this scene in my casual playthough. Bittersweet. Go to the grave after defeating the Lord of the Dragovians and unlocking the Trials.

- **Couple o' Cheeseheads (Cutscene)**: I didn't know about this scene either! It totally makes sense though, since the person you need to talk to hints at it throughout the various visits you have with them over the course of the game. Spoiler: the cheese guy at the top of the hill near Farebury is the fellow cheesehead that knows who Munchie is.

- **Birthrite (Grind)**: You need to get Hero to level 65. That means metal slimes. Lots of them. If you are like me and finished Black Citadel before this, then you will encounter less metal slimes than normal on Slime Hill. Metal king boomerang and Metal king spear with Lightning Thrust for Hero, Metal king sword for Angelo, and Conquerer's Axe with Executioner on Yangus are a big help in maximizing metal slime kills when a group ever shows up. Flee from any non-metal slime battles to save time. If you get my Favorite Group of metal slimes described in **Smelterweight/Oxidizer**, use the spear and Lightning Thrust with Hero and Executioner with Yangus focused on the metal king slime. Otherwise, Hero should use the metal king boomerang to hit a lot of metal slimes with Angelo taking out one at a time for a more efficient slaying of regular metal slimes. Of course, your mileage may vary, but this is what felt most efficient to me. Hopefully you'll get some slime crowns and orichalcum while you're at it!

- **Overkiller (Grind/Combat)**: The easy thing would be to have Jessica psyche up and use Magic Burst with a LOT of MP since you can do this on any enemy, not just bosses. Since this is total damage in a round, you can also psyche up multiple party members to at least 50 tension and then everyone unleash their strongest move on the same round. This is easier said that done however since the monster needs to survive and have at least 3000 HP through the round for it to trigger and a lot of bosses have wave of ice. Dragovian Trials dragons could be a good time to accomplish this, if you have equipment and levels to be able to sync up moves to deal out high amounts of damage in one round. Once you have the Dragovian king sword, an Oomph'd Hero at 100 tension with a Dragon Slash is capable of getting very high damage values against the Lord of the Dragovian's dragon forms as well. I was able to hit over 3000 HP of damage by Hero doing over 2500 HP with that setup while Yangus did another 500+ HP with a 50 tension attack in the same round.

- **Eight the Great (Monster Arena) and others**: Defeating the notorious monsters can be accomplished over the course of the game, though it may be better to wait until post game to finish. There is [a fantastic map of every monster location](https://www.woodus.com/den/gallery/graphics/dq8ps2/maps_overworld/infamous_monsters.webp) that I used to hunt them all down. This does NOT include the post game monsters and Hev, however.

- **True Hev-y Weight (Monster Arena)**: This is a set of six notorious monsters that are only available after having completed the game. The very last monster, Hev, is a metal king slime that appears only when chosen as one of the items after winning against the Lord of the Dragovians. The new notorious monster appears south of Trodain Castle near a small lake. Definitely a good addition to the team! The other five monsters are not on [the map of notorious monster locations](https://www.woodus.com/den/gallery/graphics/dq8ps2/maps_overworld/infamous_monsters.webp) so I have included screenshots of where I was on the map when I found them, as other resources have not been specific enough in some cases. The spot that my party is located is the location of the monster. Note that some of these monsters may be in more than one location and I am only showing where I found them. If they are not in the area in the screenshot, enter a town and return to see if they show up again.
    - Bishop, the Wight High Priest: Found to the east of Simpleton in a forest north of the road at **_night only_**
    ![](./bishop-location.png)
    - Frillsaur, the Jumbo Dilophosaur: Located near Tryan Gully north of the bridge containing the Arch-Archdemon and close to where you land if using the Godbird at **_daytime only_**
    ![](./frillsaur-location.png)
    - Gryphus, the Gryphon General: Located on the plateau accessible only by Godbird between the Mystical Spring and the Peddler's Tent, near the chest that contains a Flametang Boomerang, at **_daytime only_**
    ![](./gryphus-location.png)
    - Mornstar, the Headless Flailsman: Located in front of the cave the leads to the snow region/Orkutsk at **_night only_**
    ![](./mornstar-location.png)
    - Spot, the Greater Sabrecat: Located on the road between Chateau Felix and the plateau to the Dragovian Path at **_daytime only_**

- **Bestiary Bester (Grind)**: This [guide of all enemy locations in the bestiary](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/41831) is pretty good! I highly recommend it for filling out any of the blank spots. My bestiary progress was great in getting filled out as I progressed through the game. The only things that were really missing by the time I got to the post game, other than the Dragovian trial enemies, were monsters in the ocean and beaches. Crayzee proved to be problematic initially, as I was searching the beach south of Argonia at night. However, it never seemed to show there, so I feel like that was the wrong place. I did find Crayzee fairly quickly once I Zoomed to the Pirate's Cove and whistled for encounters. Foul Anchor also caused some problems because they seemingly can just appear anywhere in the ocean. I found them when sailing from the unexplored island where I searched for the Abyss Diver heading north toward the Dark Ruins island.

- **Tireless Terminator Tycoon (Grind)**: What a fucking grind this is! By the time I finished the bestiary, other than the remaining Dragovian Trial bosses, I was just over three quarters of the way done... oof. Maybe grinding gold golems is the way to accomplish this? Certainly would be easier than constantly going through the Heavenly Dais... Gold golems is what I ended up doing and it didn't take very long to get the last 30k gold I needed.

- **Divine Destroyer (Combat/Grind)**: I lost in my first attempt. I think I may have been under leveled (I still didn't have Dragon Soul unlocked yet) but the Divine Dragon also used waves of ice a lot. In my second attempt, I had completed the grind to get Hero to level 65 and unlocking the Dragon Soul ability, but the dragon also only used the disruptive wave once. It also was doing more physical attacks rather than c-c-cold breath attacks too. So, maybe there was a luck factor involved as well. I was more aggressive too in my attacks, psyching up only to 20 tension and maybe hitting 50 tension if Jessica went first with the timbrel of tension. Hero supported healing with Fullheal when necessary, or Yangus would use the sage's stone to aid Angelo's Multiheal if a c-c-cold breath was used.

- **Ultimate Dragon Warrior (Combat)**: I was not at all expecting that you would be required to fight all of the dragon forms prior to fighting the Ultimate Dragon. What a thrilling victory this was! I managed to do it on my first attempt but it was scary close. I used my The King and Us monster team to heal and resurrect during the divine dragon portion and lost one of the slimes in one shot so I was unable to have the team again as a backup when actually facing the ultimate dragon.I had to rely on Kazing from Angelo and Zing from Hero, as well as my stock of Yggdrasil leaves to bring characters back as they were taken down. Ultimate dragon hits HARD and any one character taking more than one hit in a row was going to die. Since I had Magic Burst on Jessica as the character to max their Fisticuffs for the **Peerless Punch 'n' Punt Prodigy** achievement, this is where I used it. I forgot to bring Elfin elixirs though so I only had one use of it. I balanced Angelo's healing with Hero's Fullheal or Yangus' sage stone. Jessica primarily used the timbrel of tension and Hero and Yangus attacked with Dragon Slash/Dragon Soul and Helm Splitter respectively when they had an opportunity. Since the ultimate dragon does have disruptive wave AND war cry, it was better to attack more frequently than try to build up tension too high while also risking potential death at any moment. Eventually I won with a 5 tension Dragon Soul right after Jessica died to a physical/cold breath combo.

- **For the Love of Cheese (Grind)**: My final achievement before getting the good ending achievement and mastery of the set. At first this seems like it would be a slog, but it actually isn't all that bad, especially with fast forward and going for this in the post game. You can buy fresh milk and rennet powder in the indoor bazaar in Argonia. Brew up a bunch of cheese in your instant alchemy pot. Whistle for encounters and use two cheeses. It'll take at the most 50 encounters and 100 cheese. The reason I say "at the most" is because of a quirk of the game tracking the cheese use, if you use a cheese but the last enemy is defeated before the cheese is actually consumed, it still counts toward the measurement. A bug in the player's favor! Happy grinding!
