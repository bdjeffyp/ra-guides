This is not an official manual, walkthrough, or critical review. This document is a guide for the current achievement set (325 achievements as of August 23rd, 2025) available on [RetroAchievements](https://retroachievements.org/game/5803). This guide will give the player tips on earning the achievements, hash compatibility, and any other necessary or useful information. It may point to other resources for specific game walkthroughs that are not focused on the achievements themselves.

As with some of the other guides I've made, spoiler solutions for the boss strategies and a potential order to earning the achievements will be hidden in a collapsible entry that you must click to expand so that only the solutions you need assistance with will be viewable. Some of the more minor achievements will have strategies written outright without a collapsible dropdown so use the guide at your own risk.

## Introduction

Final Fantasy XII: International Zodiac Job System (IZJS) is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation 2. This version of Final Fantasy XII was released only in Japan on August 9th, 2007 and other Asian territories that same year. A fan-made English translation patch for this game, and what is used for the RetroAchievements set, was initially released on October 11th, 2009, injecting the official script from the original game's American localization into the game and translating the few new things added in. The world finally got a further updated version of Final Fantasy XII with The Zodiac Age, bringing along the changes from IZJS with some further additions and enhancements.

IZJS overhauls the original game's license board system, turning every character into a unique role by giving them a "job" similar to previous Final Fantasy job system roles. Each job has a unique license board that limits the available abilities, weapons, armor, and more that a character has access to. This makes each character unique compared to the blank slates they were in the original game. However, this change means that planning ahead for the roles your characters fill is necessary as once you pick a job, it can never be changed.

This game is highly flexible in how you can accomplish the main and optional objectives throughout. Some of the challenges in this RetroAchievements set may seem "impossible" given particular job assignment choices you make. However, there are actually very few restrictions with your job choices (I'll point out what you should specifically keep in mind later) as pretty much everything can be accomplished by any one character if you are willing to put in work on fallback methods or experimenting with abilities you may not have used in a casual playthrough of the game.

As with other RPGs, missables abound as you progress through the story. While not as egregious as some other games, there are situations that occur that can prevent accomplishing achievements after certain points. This guide is designed to help you avoid these missable situations, especially the boss level caps, so that you can master the set in one playthrough.

## Trivia

- As mentioned briefly above, IZJS didn't come out worldwide until The Zodiac Age version. However, The Zodiac Age has even more changes over IZJS, with two jobs per character, can change jobs, high definition remaster of graphics, autosave, and so on. This makes IZJS arguably the "more difficult" version of Final Fantasy XII.

- Final Fantasy XII is set in the world of Ivalice, previously featured in the Final Fantasy Tactics spinoff games created by Yasumi Matsuno.

***TODO***: More... MORE!!!

## Save Support

The game uses PS2 memory cards to save games with up to 50 save slots per card. Since this is being played with an emulator for RetroAchievements support, it is **HIGHLY** recommended that you make use of all slots in order to minimize the possibility of being locked out of a missable achievement. You can even make more than one memory card file to make saves across multiple memory cards. In my playthrough experience, I only needed one memory card, but I used 42 slots for the main game and most of the remaining slots for Trial Mode so I got close to needing more than one memory card.

## Compatibility

***TODO***: Update the date here when done!

Currently (as of August 23rd, 2025) this game has only 1 unique hash registered for it. View linked hashes at the [Supported Game Files](https://retroachievements.org/game/5803/hashes) page.

Please view the Final Fantasy XII: IZJS [Official Forum Topic](https://retroachievements.org/forums/topic/16920) for more details.

Want to see other language patches get supported with a RetroAchievements set? Learn more about how to do [Compatibility Testing](https://docs.retroachievements.org/guidelines/content/player-compatibility-testing.html)!

## Leaderboards

There are currently 10 leaderboards associated with Final Fantasy XII: IZJS. Unfortunately, a few of them are not very useful since they are tracking a statistic that is capped and thus there are a lot of people tied for 1st place for those boards.

### Competitive boards

- [True Time Mage](https://retroachievements.org/leaderboardinfo.php?i=46081) - Finish Normal Mode with the fastest time (a regular New Game speedrun type leaderboard).
- [Step It Up](https://retroachievements.org/leaderboardinfo.php?i=46082) - Complete the game with the lowest number of steps.
- [Master Thief](https://retroachievements.org/leaderboardinfo.php?i=46286) - Complete the game (Normal or Weak Mode allowed) with the highest amount of successful steals. This presumably has a cap of 32,767 like other similar boards, but no one has hit that cap yet.
- [King of the Clan](https://retroachievements.org/leaderboardinfo.php?i=46288) - Complete the game (Normal or Weak Mode allowed) with the highest Clan points.
- [Balling on a Budget](https://retroachievements.org/leaderboardinfo.php?i=46289) - Complete the game (Normal or Weak Mode allowed) with the least amount of gil spent.
- [Trial of the Time Gods](https://retroachievements.org/leaderboardinfo.php?i=46290) - Finish Trial Mode with the fastest time.

### Non-competitive boards

These four could be more interesting if they were tracking the lowest amounts, rather than the highest. The caps for all of these statistics is 32,767.

- [Attacking Ivalice](https://retroachievements.org/leaderboardinfo.php?i=46283) - Complete the game with the highest amount of uses of the Attack command.
- [Teck Support](https://retroachievements.org/leaderboardinfo.php?i=46284) - Complete the game with the highest amount of uses of Technicks.
- [Hogwarts in Ivalice](https://retroachievements.org/leaderboardinfo.php?i=46285) - Complete the game with the highest amount of uses of Magicks.
- [Dancing in Blood](https://retroachievements.org/leaderboardinfo.php?i=46287) - Complete the game with the highest amount of enemies killed.

## Achievement Categories

***TODO***: Obviously will overhaul this...

There are a currently (as of March 11, 2024) a total of 208 achievements, which can be broken down into the following categories:

- **[Story/Progression](#storyprogression)**: 32 achievements earned naturally through the course of gameplay (only up to the game's normal ending)
- **[Side Quest](#side-quest)**: 30 achievements (**9 are missable**) which are unlocked from completing requests or talking to specific NPCs are certain times throughout the main adventure, including in the post game
- **[Cutscene](#cutscene)**: 15 achievements (**8 are missable**) that are earned from viewing a specific cutscene or dialogue with an NPC/party member
- **[Cor Blimey](#cor-blimey)**: 13 achievements (**6 are missable**), a subset of the Cutscene category, revolving around the various "COR BLIMEY" moments throughout the game.
- **[Challenge](#challenge)**: 24 achievements (**23 are missable**) that require special action during boss fights or meet a condition throughout the entire game
- **[Lists](#lists)**: 34 achievements (**1 is missable**) involve progression toward and completing the various lists that are in game, such as alchemy recipes and the monster bestiary
- **[Grind](#grind)**: 29 achievements (**3 are missable**) that use actions taken by characters in battle a specific number of times or may require multiple battles to meet the requirements, as well as skill point category maxing and alchemy grinding
- **[Item Exchange](#item-exchange)**: 6 achievements, a subset of the Lists category, for Dodgy Dave and Princess Minnie, exchanging the specific alchemy items and mini-medals for certain rewards
- **[Monster Arena](#monster-arena)**: 8 achievements, a subset of the Side Quest category, for advancing in the monster arena and other arena related quests
- **[Treasure](#treasure)**: 17 achievements (**3 are missable**) which require finding all treasure chests in a given region or dungeon

Out of all of the achievements, a total of **53 are missable**

## Potential Order

***TODO***: Obviously will overhaul this...

The following is a breakdown of the order of achievements based on my personal playthrough. Note that this is only a potential order for you to follow and not a strict timing on when achievements should be unlocked, especially when grind achievements are considered.

Each section is grouped under story achievements and hidden under a dropdown to avoid spoilers. If you want to see the achievements, **click on the arrow** next to each section to reveal the table. The dropdown names have the number of achievements in the section so that you can see at a glance about how many achievements you should have by the end of a section, if you were to follow my guide to the letter. If you want to see the entire thing without having to click the arrows, [checkout the fully expanded roadmap!](Dragon-Quest-VIII-Roadmap)

:no_entry: **MINOR SPOILER SECTION** :no_entry:
<br>The tables only reveal when achievements can be earned and possibly missed. No strategies on earning the achievements are provided here, just the approximate order I earned them in.

**Grind alert!** This is the point where I started to grind for metal slimes and gaining levels and maxing skills. You may decide to do this at a different time that I did, saving it for the postgame or perhaps as soon as you got the Godbird's soulstone. As stated above, your mileage may vary.

**Grind alert!** The final stretch will require a significant amount of time getting the remaining skill maxing as well as getting Hero to level 65 for the Dragon Soul ability. While there are probably plenty of good lower level strategies to beating the Dragovian Trials, it's probably more efficient to just get the levels and skills you need before completing the final Trial. In my playthrough, I made occasional breaks from metal slime grinding to go do a Dragovian Trial, and then head back to the grind. Have fun!

## Category Breakdowns

***TODO***: Obviously will overhaul all of this...

The category sections below contain each achievement in the section with tips or suggestions on how to unlock them. Not every achievement may warrant an in-depth discussion and the tips/suggestions I provide may not be the the most ideal. I'm open to feedback on how better to meet an achievement's requirements, as I have done with my previous guides. Feel free to [message me via RetroAchievements DM](https://retroachievements.org/messages/create?to=bdjeffyp) to discuss better strategies and I'll update them here with credit given.

Good luck in your achievement hunting!

### General advice

The following is some overall strategies to make your playthrough and achievement hunting with Dragon Quest VIII as painless as possible, while also completing your mastery in one run.

- **Alchemy recipe tracking**: I created a [checklist for tracking your progress on alchemy recipes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ce8GHR2nSsI-ArWagsF2-yS-t5rjWYEyFdRzfKcDAE/edit?usp=sharing) on Google Sheets. I didn't like that the [100% walkthrough guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/43062) didn't identify what the recipes made. It was also noted by RA user [Akai](https://retroachievements.org/user/Akai) in the [I Did 'Em Alchemyself achievement forums](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250749) that the 100% guide was missing one recipe. So, I used both the 100% guide as well as [Dragon's Den recipe guide](https://www.woodus.com/den/games/dq83ds/alchemy.php) to put together the checklist. The order of the recipes in the same as the 100% guide, with the one missing recipe at the very end of the list. With this checklist, I made sure to complete all recipes and verified its accuracy and completeness.

- **Saving**: Please, please, please, PLEASE make full use of your memory card! The last thing you want to do is make all of your saves on one slot. Dragon Quest VIII provides you with 30 slots per memory card. I am reiterating what was stated in the [Save Support](#save-support) section it is just that important. The best time to make a new save is just prior to making an attempt on a Challenge category achievement. Having multiple saves definitely helped me in a couple of instances where I missed an achievement because of a small timing window. Please don't forget to make use of all that space!

- **Dungeons and boss challenges**: The nature of how save games work in Dragon Quest games, combined with the [Peerless Protector](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250136) achievement's requirement, make dealing with dungeons and boss fight challenges a different level of tricky as compared to a typical Final Fantasy boss achievement. The way I mitigated these types of challenge achievements is by breaking up dungeons in two visits, when possible. The first visit (or more, if needed) is for clearing out the dungeon of treasures. Once that is done, Evac and Zoom to town to save. The next visit will then be for the attempts at the boss challenge. The nice thing about this approach is that death doesn't undo as much work when reverting to a previous save in order to maintain [Peerless Protector](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250136) while also ensuring that you are keeping your experience AND your money earned. If things get too spicy in a dungeon, don't be afraid to Evac early to recover and save your progress. This approach also helps with increasing distance traveled, brewing alchemy recipes, and maintaining new encounters logged in the bestiary.

- **Other guides**: The first time I played through Dragon Quest VIII completely was on the 3DS but I certainly didn't accomplish 100% of the game in that playthrough. In order to make sure I didn't miss anything while mastering this achievement set, the primary guide I utilized is the [100% walkthrough guide on GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/43062). As with most guides, there are bound to be errors but this one was nearly perfect. I also used the [Spells and Skills guide on GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/40285) for identifying my skill point distribution route. Also handy were the Dragon's Den overworld maps that identify [treasures](https://www.woodus.com/den/gallery/graphics/dq8ps2/maps_overworld/tresure_chests.webp), [notorious monsters](https://www.woodus.com/den/gallery/graphics/dq8ps2/maps_overworld/infamous_monsters.webp), and [cow locations](https://www.woodus.com/den/gallery/graphics/dq8ps2/maps_overworld/DQ8_Cows_Map.webp)!

:no_entry: **HERE, THERE BE SPOILERS!** :no_entry:

Boss challenges provide a unique spin on typical boss fights, forcing you to take actions you would not normally do in a casual playthough. These tend to become interesting puzzles to figure out. If you wish to challenge yourself, I recommend not expanding the strategies I used. As a reminder, the flexibility of the combat system means that my strategies are not the hard and fast rule to meeting the requirements of the achievement. If you have recommended solutions to these challenges, I'd be more than happy to add them here. Just [send me a DM on RetroAchievements](https://retroachievements.org/messages/create?to=bdjeffyp)!

### Grind

My overall strategy when grinding is as follows:
- **Combat**: Once you have the Godbird's soulstone, you can fly to Howlwind Hill, also known as Slime Hill, located just north of Rydon's Tower. All slime family enemies are here, including metal slime variants. Just stay in one spot, Whistle for an encounter, and fight! Mercurial/Lightning Thrust and Hatchet Man/Executioner are your friend. Unfortunately, after completing the Black Citadel, dark slimes and sabrecats will also appear here, which can slow down the amount of metal slimes that make an appearance... Prior to the Black Citadel, metal slimes seem to appear frequently at all times. After Black Citadel, they only really seem to appear most at night. In other news, I seemed like I was able to intimidate more enemies during the postgame so I built up my intimidate count here too. I did check out the unexplored island and found the liquid metal slime appearance rate to be too little compared to Slime Hill. Getting the Metal King Boomerang can help with the regular metal slime groups that show up too. I was able to take down a 6 out of 9 metal slimes using that boomerang along with Executioner and Angelo with a metal king sword.
    - I am a big fan of seeing this encounter which seemed to show up a decent amount during my time on Slime Hill before the Black Citadel:
![An enemy encounter consisting of a Metal King Slime flanked by three Liquid Metal Slimes on both sides](https://i.imgur.com/LArc2KJ.png)
- **Alchemy brewing**: Before getting the instant pot, once I got the Hilltop Hut zoom spot unlocked, I use the fenced in area outside the hut to run in circles while fast forwarding the emulator at 300%. This was also a useful spot for speeding up Medea's water consumption when working on getting Mystical Spring scenes for [Enduring Endearment](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250124).

### Treasure

In this section, I am only going to highlight the missable treasure achievements rather than discuss all of them, since there are plenty of other resources out there that already go into detail on this. The main thing to keep in mind is that a lot of the region treasure achievements will require revisits later, either with the magic key or ultimate key. So don't worry if you finish a scenario in a region and you don't have the associated treasure achievement unlocked yet.

One major note: **Don't forget that mimics COUNT** toward opening all treasure chests in a region or dungeon.

For convenience sake, here are the guides that are helpful in finding all of the treasures:

## Notes

Okay, so right now I've only barely started the game and am just taking some notes to figure things out and see if I even want to continue with this guide...

Some things I've noticed so far:
- Not sure if all of the missables are actually called out. This is a set Snow participated in, though siouxerskate did the majority of the achievements and marked plenty of missables so perhaps it is accurate. It's something I'll need to be hyper-vigilant for, of course.
- Shortly after completing the tutorial Hunt for the Rogue Tomato and the cutscenes that follow when returning to Rabanastre, primed achievement markers appear for two missable achievements: A Crucial Piece and Quick as the Wind.
  - A Crucial Piece is for obtaining the Diamond Armlet early. This requires going to Dalmasca Westersand: Windtrace Dunes area and opening chest 36 which has a 25% appearance rate (according to Fandom wiki...). I'm still figuring out where chest 36 will spawn currently.
  - Quick as the Wind is for getting the Gladius dagger early. It's found in Dalmasca Estersand: The Yoma area and opening chest 48 (item 2 in the chest, which appears 75% of the time and has a 35% chance of just being gil, according to Fandom wiki... I believe this has really low odds overall). Getting to this location during the period the achievement asks for as well as the chest location is unknown currently. Further research shows that the intent for this achievement is to steal it from the Lindbur Wolf in Dalmasca Westersand: Shimmering Horizons (it appears after chaining 20+ wolves) in the separate area in the northeast.
- Looks like a collection of maps for the Zodiac versions of the game, to include IZJS, is found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1292596668.
- There are a bunch of boss fight achievements that have specific restrictions. Most include preventing use of the Seitengrat and have a level cap. So keeping an eye on levels will be important to call out.
  - The restriction "No HP to 0" means that no party members can die during the boss fight.
- Getting the Seitengrat will be its own special bit of fun, involving RNG manipulation, because it is incredibly rare to appear.
- The F.I.N.A.L. F.A.N.T.A.S.Y. achievement requires the collection of special weapons that have a letter at the end of their name, such as the Scorpion Tail F hammer. It's only missable because if you sell any of them, then you'll not unlock this.
- The Sky Pirate's Den is an internal achievement system the IZJS version implemented. Naturally, the set ties achievements to the statues that appear in the Den. There is an unfortunate issue with how the game stores if these statues are unlocked for some of the achievements that requires opening up the Sky Pirate's Den to unlock the achievement. If you save and quit the game with the statue unlocked and not the achievement, you'll miss these particular achievements because of save protection that was implemented.
  - There is no notification that you unlock something in the Sky Pirate's Den. It's up to the player to check it after before saving and quitting their play session.
- The Where is the Zodiac Spear? achievement is going to be a pain point I believe. You have to check the Necrohol of Nabudis' Cloister of the Highborn for chest 22, which as a 3% spawn rate to find the Ensanguined Shield. The name of this achievement is a reference to the fact that this chest is the one that would have the Zodiac Spear if the requirements were met. The other reason why this is a pain point is because you need to go to this location and find this chest with the shield before entering the Sochen Cave Palace for the first time. If I remember right, you pass by the Necrohol on the way to Sochen and comments from characters state that the Necrohol is dangerous and you should go there and it is never required by the story. I see talk about the [Immobilize Glitch](https://antifandom.com/finalfantasy/wiki/Immobilize_glitch) which may be helpful for traversing the area while low leveled that may still work in IZJS.
- RNG manipulation really seems to be the name of the game here in getting some of these rare things to appear. Either that, or a shit ton of patience...
- Overall, the set is a disordered mess. Achievements are all over the place and don't follow a logical flow. I can understand that some of them may not be possible (like the Sky Pirate's Den achievements) though... My roadmap may be able to help some here.
  - Another look at the set now over these past few weeks has given me the chance to see that the achievements are grouped together with like types of achievements: story, bosses, treasure, stealing, poaching, Trial Mode, hunts, etc. This format makes sense for this game, given that there is a ton of flexibility in when players can unlock them. Even my roadmap will be unique and tough to categorize though it should give people an idea of when they should have certain achievements unlocked by.
- There are achievements for various rewards from the Hunt Club outfitters. If I remember right, there are some mutually exclusive options here? This may require multiple saves or saving before hand to select one and then the other. I'll need to dig into that more when I get to that area.
- Trial mode is separate from the main game and the achievements are similarly separate. There is only one missable involving stealing the Excalibur from and defeating Hell Wyrm. Working on Trial Mode will be reserved for the post game file.
- For RNG manipulation stuff, the [RNG Helper application (Windows only)](https://github.com/blakehartley/RNGHelper/releases) is quite handy for finding the right RNG position that will enable you to steal or obtain a desired item from a chest. There is also a website that I found that is useful for non-Windows people: https://markegli.com/ff12/

Overall, I can see this as being a set that puts people off because there are so many achievements and everything is seemingly disorganized (though I think I understand the layout a bit more).

I'll focus these notes for now on the achievements that take place between the story beats (i.e. the progression achievements).

### General things to remember

- There are achievements associated with the bestiary. When entering new places, you may want to take the time to scout for enemies you haven't fought before. None of the bestiary achievements (**Hunter of Monsters I through IV**, **Big Game Hunter I and II**, and **Show Off I and II**) are marked as missable, so in theory you should be able to go back to most locations and find all the monsters in the game.
  - Currently, I don't believe that this requires the full bestiary entry either (fighting the same monster until the entry adds a second page). The achievement measurement increases as soon as an interaction with a new monster occurs, even when an NPC fights a new monster.
  - I'm noticing that **Big Game Hunter I and II** and **Show Off I and II** don't seem to have measured tracking. I'm guessing maybe the set devs felt the smaller quantity of entries was worth not bothering with the tracking?
- While rare game may appear as you explore areas on the way to the next boss or story moment, it's probably wise to only fight rare game IF it shows up, rather than trying to force their appearance. This is to ensure that levels are kept low to avoid getting close to the level caps for boss challenges. If you feel that your levels may be lagging a bit, that shouldn't be a problem, but keep extra save files just in case. I will do a rare game (and bestiary) cleanup after finishing the game to ensure that my levels don't get too high.
- Guest characters levels will matter when worrying about the level caps for boss challenges. A guest character level will be calculated when they join with the following calculation:
  - Larsa and Reddas: average of the two highest level characters + 2 levels
  - Vossler: average of the two highest level characters + 4 levels
  - *Example*: You have a party of levels 14, 14, 15, 15, 15, 16. Vossler joins. His level will be 19 because 4 plus 15 (15 and 16 average rounded down).
- Chain level notes:
  - ***TODO***: Fill out details here on building chain level and its intricacies
- Zone out glitch: This is something that may be key for you to build chain on certain enemies that only appear once in an area. When killed, this monster won't spawn again until you leave the area and return. If you leave a zone while a monster is dying but before the Exp and LP appear on screen, the chain will increase but the monster won't be considered "killed" so it will reappear when you return to the zone.
  - There are a couple of instances were this is really useful for achievements so I will call out using the zone out glitch. For example, using Dustia to chain reaper type monsters for getting Nightwalker's very rare drop.

### Jobs

For the most part, job selection doesn't matter too much other than making your game play experience easier or more challenging. Ideally, you will want to pick jobs that are varied so that you can form teams of three that can act in the primary roles of Tank (takes the hits and enemy aggro), Healer (heals the party and provides other support), and the damage dealer also known as the DPS for "damage per second" (doles out the primary damage to the enemies). Here is the job assignments I gave my characters, based on what some sources were stating is the "popular" choice, with some exception:
- Vaan: Monk
- Penelo: Black Mage
- Balthier: White Mage
- Fran: Red Mage (Highly recommended for the **Ward of the Wood** challenge)
- Basch: Knight (I've seen people use Archer, but I went with Knight for a second Tank)
- Ashe: Samurai

An issue with this particular setup is the achievements requiring use of the Poach skill. Poach is easily accessible on the license board for the Uhlan, Machinist, Time Mage, and Archer. It is also available for Black Mage if that job is assigned to Vaan, Balthier, or Fran because they naturally have the Steal license. Since I used Penelo for Black Mage and none of the other jobs were assigned in my party, I **MUST** give Penelo the Zalera summon in order to access Steal and then Poach. The only affect of this that I see is Vaan losing access to Traveler and Ashe can't get the Blood Sword licenses because of this.

Fran is a particularly tough choice because her stats are lower than everyone elses so no jobs are particularly suited for her over any other. This is why I felt Red Mage made the most sense with her as that class typically is known for being a "jack of all trades but master of none". Turns out that Red Mage or Black Mage is an ideal choice for the **Ward of the Wood** challenge. Of course, there are other ways to handle this challenge that people have discussed in the achievement's comments and I'll bring them up there.

Never, ever, EVER learn Brawler. You don't want it for RNG manipulation purposes AND it isn't a very useful skill anyway.

***TODO***: If I see any other potential gotchas with achievements and the jobs, write about them here.

### Bazaar

***TODO***: Put together a spreadsheet checklist for the bazaar goods to purchase, to help with tracking **Master Deal Hunter**.

Current checklist (in progress): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NrWlghs7OjUKDOHxHjOnEImlwz_XJ0SEDRB2BOMUmG4/edit?usp=sharing

Something to keep in mind when selling loot for the purpose of unlocking bazaar goods is that there is an issue that can occur where the bazaar loses track of items sold. This happened to me with the Chronos Tear Pack. Thankfully that was just one item that is needed to unlock that good for sale, but it happened more than once when selling a bunch of items at one go. I highly recommend saving your game prior to selling a ton of loot. Sell a quantity of loot that will unlock a desired good and back out to the main shop menu to see if new bazaar goods unlocked. If it happened as you expected, great! If not, reload the save and try again. If it still isn't happening, then at this point its more likely that you have messed up your own tracking of loot selling.

The bazaar functions on providing items for purchase based on the loot items sold. Selling loot is a primary means of earning gil but has a hidden effect of being accumulated by the bazaar until enough loot is collected to unlock an item for purchase.

A byproduct of this process is that when an item is *purchased* in the bazaar, all of the loot sold is **consumed**. For example, let's look at two bazaar goods sold that require the Earth Stone loot:
- The Iron-forged Blade (which is an Iron Sword) requires selling the following loot:
  - 3 Iron Scraps
  - 2 Foul Flesh
  - 3 Earth Stone
- The Unassuming Surcoat (which is a set of Chromed Leathers) requires selling:
  - 2 Wolf Pelt
  - 1 Earth Stone
- If the player sells a bunch of Iron Scraps, Foul Flesh, and Wolf Pelts, let's say 10 of each, nothing would be unlocked in the bazaar.
- Once the player sells 2 Earth Stones, the Unassuming Surcoat becomes unlocked for purchase in the bazaar.
- If the player purchases the Unassuming Surcoat, the items used to unlock this bazaar good are now consumed! All 10 Wolf Pelts and the 2 Earth Stones are no longer in stock.
  - If the player now wants to unlock the Iron-forged Blade, they have to gather 3 Earth Stone now, because the initial 2 were used up.
- However, if the bazaar good is unlocked but **NOT** purchased, the loot is not yet consumed!
  - If the player were to find and sell one more Earth Stone, the Iron-forged Blade will become available for purchase in the bazaar as well.
  - With both unlocked, you can purchase both. The bazaar goods share the overlapping loot required to unlock them. Once both are unlocked, if one is purchased, the other remains unlocked for purchase as well.
- This particular aspect of the bazaar can be leveraged to make the creation of the best equipment in the game easier.
  - One of the big examples of this is how the Kumbha/Masamune I and Tournesol, two of the best weapons in the game, are unlocked in the bazaar:
    - Kumbha/Masamune I requires selling 2 Gemsteel, 3 Orichalcum, and 2 Mallet.
    - Tournesol requires selling 3 Gemsteel, 3 Empyreal Soul, and 3 Serpentarius.
    - Gemsteel is not something that can be gathered from stealing or dropping from enemies! It is a bazaar good, sold as Matchless Metal, that requires selling 1 Scarletite, 2 Damascus Steel, and 2 Hell-Gate's Flame.
    - As an example, the efficient thing to do is to unlock BOTH of these weapons at once by only selling 3 Gemsteel rather than 5. It is much easier to gather only 3 Scarletite for the Gemsteel, for example.

I *highly* recommend checking out the [Comprehensive Bazaar Guide by Tirpitz](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1293521534), especially the section on Tips and Vendoring Trick for a more detailed explanation and guidance on how the bazaar works. My discussion above is a simplification of how the system works by Tirpitz721 nails the fine points really well.

- Here is the list of loot you should hold on to until you have the quantities you need to unlock multiple bazaar items:
  - Arcana
  - High Arcana
  - Damascus Steel
  - Serpent Eye
  - Moon Ring
  - Feystone
  - Soul Powder
  - Scarletite
  - Adamantite
  - Sickle-Blade
  - Hell-Gate's Flame
  - Empyreal Soul
  - Mallet
  - Gemsteel
  - Orichalcum
  - Soul Powder (only sell 1 at a time)
  - Soul of Thamasa (only sell 1 at a time)
  - Serpent Eye (need 6 total; only sell 2 at a time)
  - Snake Skin (need 12 total; only sell 4 at a time)
  - Wargod's Band (need 6 total; only sell 2 at a time)
- The following loot should only be sold one at a time for their repeatable bazaar packs:
  - Rainbow Egg: repeatable Hi-Potion Pack
  - Behemoth Steak: repeatable X-Potion Pack
  - Demon's Sigh: repeatable Vaccine Pack
  - Eye of the Hawk: repeatable Chronos Tear Pack
- This loot should not be sold as they provide a use for other things and don't unlock any bazaar goods:
  - Teleport Stones

### Hunt Club

***TODO***: Update this below with my findings after I have done this, but it looks like have the gist of how this works down based on the research.

The Hunt Club side quest is able to be started once you have completed Draklor Laboratory. I recommend starting after you have completed the game and no longer have to worry about level caps.

At the Hunter's Camp in Phon Coast, speak the the Huntmaster to get your first mark to hunt. Once you defeat the beast and get it's trophy, the Huntmaster will let you in the club and hunt other trophy game. There are a total of 30 trophy game to hunt which only appear once. You can also distribute the trophies to one of three bangaa: Atak, Blok, and Stok. The number of trophies that each of the three gets will determine the types of equipment that is available for purchase at the Shifty-Eyed Man's store. Atak is (if you could guess from the name) focused on weapons, Blok is for armor, and Stok is for accessories.

The problem here: There are achievements for receiving a gift from the three bangaa and achievements for purchasing five specific items in the Hunt Club's shop (one is actually two items). So, how do we get all of these achievements?

To get the gift achievements, you must give at least 16 trophies to one of the bangaa, dole out the other 14, and then speak to the Huntmaster. Additionally, you can ONLY get one gift. This means that you will need to save scum, giving 16 to the one that provides the item you don't want to hang onto, then reset, give 16 to another bangaa, and finally do that one more time for the gear you want to keep..

As for the items in the shop, here are the requirements for each achievement required item:
- Masamune: 30 to Atak and purchase for 700,000 gil
- Nihopalaoa: 30 to Stok and purchase for 360,000 gil
- Grand Armor: 30 to Blok and buy for 162,000 gil
- Genji Gloves: 15 to Stok, 5 to Atak and Blok and buy for 447,000 gil
- Zodiac Spear and Zodiac Escutcheon: 10 trophies to each and buy for 999,999 gil

Okay, so this definitely means that save scumming is required to get them all in one playthrough. The question is, once you start, can you go get all of the trophy game before turning any of them in? It looks like that is case. Once the first trophy game is defeated and you speak to the Huntmaster once more, you can then hunt the remaining game and collect all the trophies. At that point, distribute as you wish to get the achievements, resetting until you finish with the final achievement of this group and have the gear that you actually want to keep.

### Sky Pirate's Den Notes

***TODO***: Have a section of lists, such as a list of all spells and technicks. This can help players who are working to avoid missing their Sky Pirate's Den achievements to have something convenient to compare against. Perhaps use a Google Sheets checklist?

**Cartographer**: This requires having entered every zone in all regions (except for one-time visit locations, the final dungeon, and areas without a mini-map). Purchasing/finding maps will enable you to just enter a zone to consider an area "fully explored" without having to light up every inch of a zone.

**Assault Striker**: Unlocked when the metric was hit without needing to go into the Den (makes sense as the game probably has a very easy value to check for number of times Attack is used).

**Master Thief**: Unlocked when the metric was hit without needing to go into the Den.

**Premier Prestidigitator**: Unlocked when the metric was reached without needing to go to the Den.

**Wayfarer**: This unlocked when I saved the game as I hit 50,010 steps. Perhaps these achievements got updated to fix the issue regarding the ones that explicitly state to check the Sky Pirate's Den so that they'll unlock when saving the game? (Nope...)

**The Unrelenting**: This unlocked as soon as I hit 50-chain.

**Blood Dancer**: This unlocked as soon as I hit the 500 enemies defeated point.

**Spellsinger**: This unlocked as soon as I hit 200 spells used.

**Plunderer**: This unlocked as soon as I accumulated over 100,000 gil during the game (don't have to have that amount all at once).

**Record Breaker** This unlocked as soon as I hit 500,000 clan points.

**Collector**: This unlocked right when I purchased the Canopic Urn. I didn't need to enter the Den itself despite what the achievement's description states.

**Spendthrift**: Unlocked when I purchased the Canopic Urn as that pushed me over the threshold of spending 1 million gil.

**Mist Walker**: Unlocked upon use of the last concurrence.

**Jack-of-All-Trades**: This is the first of these that actually required me to go into the Clan Primer for the achievement to unlock. All others up to this point unlocked upon meeting the condition, contrary to the description.

**Runeweaver**: This one also required me to open the Clan Primer to unlock the achievement. Spells, in particular, are many and having a checklist or a simple list to compare against could aid players to avoid missing this.

**Radiant Savior**: Weirdly, the boss fight wasn't the trigger for this achievement, but the actual decoration in the Sky Pirate's Den. So, this also requires opening the Clan Primer to unlock.

### Some Mechanics Notes

- You can force a character to be a Tank type by casting Decoy on them. This Green Magick spell becomes available from the Clan Provisioner when you have completed two hunts (generally Rogue Tomato and Thextera are the first two).
  - Having the Bubble Belt or casting Bubble on the decoy'd character makes them even more tanky by doubling their HP!
- While the chance for a character or enemy to do a combo is based on the RNG position, the number of attacks done in a combo is weighted by the remaining HP a character has. The lower the HP, the greater chance of doing higher combos. Being HP Critical can net you 8 or more hits in one attack!
- Putting Reflect on your party members and using attack spells on the party will hit nearby enemies with that spell three times in one cast. Having two party members slinging spells at your party brings that up to six. Seems like a good strategy for bosses that have elemental weaknesses!
- Getting Dark Energy (by heytallman):
  - Having a Dark Energy available as early as you can will make your life easier if you come upon a challenge that a particular character's job doesn't necessarily line up will. It becomes viable to get fairly easily once you have defeated Judge Bergan at Mt. Bur-Omisace, especially if you have some teleport stones to spare.
  - The bazaar good is able to be purchased repeatedly (appearing as Mysterious Substance) and requires selling the following items:
    - 1x Bat Wing
      - Dropped by Seekers in Tomb of Raithwall if you have the Hunter's Monograph with a 20% drop rate. If you didn't get the monograph before the story takes you to Tomb of Raithwall, you may need to travel back there to get the Bat Wing you need. This monograph is available for sale in the bazaar for 18,000 gil after completing the Thextera hunt and speaking Gatsly in Rabanastre - Muthru Bazaar afterword.
    - 3x Grimoire Togail
      - The common drop of Nightmares in Henne Mines - Phase 1 Dig.
    - 3x Grimoire Aidhed
      - The rare drop or uncommon steal from Mallicants in Zertinan Caverns. They are located south of the zone where you fight Adrammelech. The level of these enemies are why it is ideal to wait until after the Mt. Bur-Omisace events in the story. Use the Thief's Cuffs obtained in Zertinan Caverns to steal these.
  - Sell this loot in the quantities above so that you aren't using too many items to make one Dark Energy.
  - Feel free to use the Dark Energy to wrap up a tough challenge, then reset to your previous save and fight the boss normally to retain the Dark Energy for another challenge later.

### A Treaty Signed With Steel ➡️ Exit Stage Right

For RNG manipulation using Reks, while going through the prologue, you'll come across a Save Crystal. Use it and set aside a save slot for Reks in the prologue. Make the save after passing the room with the Save Crystal and Reks tells Basch to head toward the King while he handles the soldiers approaching from the back. You'll use this save to set up RNG for other saves using the [RNG Helper](https://github.com/blakehartley/RNGHelper/releases) tool. You can use the other party members in other saves as well, but it sounds like Reks makes things easier. Keep a save handy just in case. When you need to use Reks for RNG manipulation, you'll load the save and then head downstairs from the Save Crystal where soldiers spawn infinitely to get the values you need to record into the RNG Helper tool.

The first achievement to unlock will be **A Treaty Signed With Steel** for completing the prologue with Reks.

***Level Caps***: The first level cap for boss fight challenges is level 12. It is a ways off but if you approach level 9 or 10, consider escaping from fights where you are able.

**Zodiac's Calling** (Characters): After gaining control of Vaan, following the story beats that take you to The Sandsea, and learning about hunts at the Hunt Board, you'll gain access to the license board and picking a job. Select the job you want to give to Vaan to unlock this achievement. For the record, I'm using the following jobs:
- Vaan: Monk
- Penelo: Black Mage
- Balthier: White Mage
- Fran: Red Mage (highly recommended for a later challenge)
- Basch: Knight
- Ashe: Samurai

**A Small Deed** (Side quest): This is missable and requires speaking to a seemingly random NPC in Rabanastre: Southern Plaza. Near the fountain in the plaza is a Bangaa labeled as Desert Merchant speaking with an Imperial Guard. Talk to them and accept their request to get a Small Package. Once you go through the door to Eastgate, you can no longer go back and speak to the Bangaa again, missing this achievement. Give the Small Package to another Bangaa labeled as Hapless Merchant located near the Save Crystal to get... nothing but this achievement. Selling the Small Package without giving it to the Hapless Merchant would also prevent getting this.

**Cartographer** (Sky Pirate's Den): To unlock this, you need to "fully explore" each area in the game. However, purchasing maps from the Cartographer's Guild will count an area as fully explored when you purchase the associated map. The first guild moogle is found in Rabanastre: Southern Plaza in an alcove in the northwest. Purchase the three maps that they have on hand when you have the funds. It'll cost 630 gil total to get all three.

**Red & Rotten in the Desert** (Hunts): This is the first Hunt you'll get in the game, acting as a tutorial of sorts for how they work and how these marks are different from normal fiends. The Rogue Tomato is found in the first area outside of Rabanastre: Eastgate, in Dalmasca Estersand: The Stepping. The mark is located on an elevated location near the center of the area. See the map here and look for the "M": https://images.steamusercontent.com/ugc/942811548910289216/429DC77D3A719DE762BF2B2F9C138CCC9CE06A49/. You can defeat it at level 1 fairly easily. I stole a Pebble from it and then attacked for the remainder of the fight and had just over half health remaining by the end. Defeat the fiend, go through the events that allow reentry into Rabanastre, then let Tomaj, the hunt petitioner, know you were successful to receive the reward and the achievement. After getting the reward, I got the bill for and accepted the Thextera hunt from the Hunt Board and Gatsly in The Sandsea.

Upon gaining control of Vaan after returning to Rabanastre and seeing the cutscenes, the **A Crucial Piece** and **Quick As the Wind** achievements will be primed. I assume that these show up to inform the player that events that lock out these missables (speaking to Old Dalan after completing his quest) is coming up.
- Note that these achievements mention "returning to Old Dalan" and "giving a sunstone to Old Dalan". That means that you can visit Dalan to get the quest moving and then work on getting these two achievements.
- Make the Sunstone in the Giza Plains with Penelo now in your party. Set her job if you wish and feel free to gain some license points and a level or two (the first level gate is 12, so that's a ways off).
- Once the Sunstone is made, do NOT return to Lowtown and Dalan. You will miss these primed achievements. Worst case, if getting them is taking a long time and you want to move on, make a save and use a new save slot for your continued progress so you can return here later and try again. I confirmed that the achievements become missable on the return visit to Dalan, when the cutscene in Garamsythe Waterway is shown after handing over the Sunstone.
- Having Penelo with you to get these two items and achievements will be invaluable. She can heal while Vaan steals. I'll get to the details in a moment.
- Doing these before progressing the story further means you can't program Gambits yet. That'll make things a bit more manual, unfortunately.

**Ivalice Explorer** (???): On the way to Lowtown and the Giza Plains for the Sunstone quest, you'll find your first Teleport Save Crystal at Rabanastre: South Gate. This will be the first of many! Use it to register the location (and perhaps save your game) so that you can use a Teleport Stone to warp to it from any other orange crystal.

**A Crucial Piece** (Treasure?): While grinding on gaining chain on wolves in Dalmasca Westersand, take the northwest exit of the Shimmering Horizons zone into an isolated area of Windtrace Dunes. This location is very dangerous at this point in the game, so it's a good idea to turn battle speed down and just hold onto R2 to stay in Escape mode as you make your way across the zone to the exit. The Windtrace Dunes has two Alraune and an Alpha Wolf guarding the area and the chest has a 25% chance to spawn (chest 36 on the map: https://images.steamusercontent.com/ugc/942811548910304149/C750608AD179F650595FD0DE2FF9316976429BA1/). It shouldn't take too long to get it to show up but it may be ideal to hop into the nearby entrance to Zertinan Caverns to deaggro the enemies, if needed, and ensure the treasures in the Windtrace Dunes reset. Stock up on Potions to heal up as needed. I first tried to get this at level 2, which was a disaster. I got up to level 4 and was able to take more damage, but I was also being more cautious in avoiding aggro. It seems like the Alraune like to hang out on the path around to where the chest spawns so if there is an opening, you can run along the right side to a cliff that overlooks where the chest and Alpha Wolf hang out to see if it has spawned or not. Once the chest has spawned, as soon as you grab it, the achievement will unlock. So, if you don't want to bother with keeping it for now and wait to get it later, simply reset or die to get back to your last save and carry on with the game. 
- Note about chests: I believe they only require one screen transition to respawn in this version, but I'm not 100% certain on that. My initial tests are showing that this is true.

**Quick As the Wind** (Steal/Poach): While trying to get levels for **A Crucial Piece**, I found that the Hyenas in Giza Plains count toward the wolf chain (I believe this is because of the type of the fiend in the bestiary). Unfortunately, it does not seem that this will cause the Lindbur Wolf to spawn... I had 24 chain from hyenas and went to the spawn location but it was a no-show. Thankfully, fighting Westersand wolves at level 4 isn't terrible at all. From Giza Plains: Starfall Field, take the west exit out to Dalmasca Westersand: Shimmering Horizons. Start taking out wolves all around the Westersand and building up chain (Alpha Wolf, regular Wolf, and even Hyenas on Giza Plains count). Keep in mind that entering any safe areas or interacting with a Save Crystal will reset your chain. Once the chain reaches 20, head to the isolated section of Shimmering Horizons. Some sources say that chain is not required, however building chain makes it very easy to keep track. The Lindbur Wolf should be present. Slow down the battle speed all the way so that you have time to run out of the zone in an emergency. Queue up the Steal action on Vaan while not aggroing the target until the action is ready, then approach and try to get the steal. Run right back to the exit of the zone to avoid taking damage if at all possible. If you made a Black Mage (ideally on Penelo), you can Blind the Lindbur Wolf with the spell you find in Giza Plains: Toam Hills. A lot of people seemed to find getting levels and HP on Vaan was helpful, but I wanted to find a way to get this without grinding. Unfortunately, it did mean having to lock Penelo into a specific job in the beginning, but thankfully it was a job I wanted her to have. There are plenty of other strategies people gave in the achievement's comments as well. I tried landing Blind and stealing at level 4 and didn't have much luck. I was doing better at level 5, but death still came quickly when the monster was able to land blows, despite having elevated HP. I managed a lucky encounter with a Fideliant (contributing toward **Show Off I and II**) in the Westersand's Midfault while passing through which got me level 6 with one Phoenix Down to kill it. When I succeeded after a couple of tries and getting the rhythm down for the setup and execution of the strategy, I was at level 6, buffed up Vaan to 566 HP from the license board with the Monk class, and Penelo with Blind and a couple of Magick Lore spots unlocked. Turn off Gambits for Vaan and Penelo. Penelo opens with Blind, which would land after one or two tries (I have seen that there is a flat 75% chance on vulnerable fiends but also varying chance based on a formula, not sure what to believe there...), while Vaan queues up Steal. There is a 3% chance of getting the Gladius. While trying to get Blind to proc, inch back toward the exit of the zone as you continue to try to steal or heal up Vaan. If Blind is taking too many attempts, escape the zone and reassess if you need to heal up, get more resources, or start over. After Blind is affecting the Lindbur Wolf, Vaan concentrates on Steal while Penelo heals with potions. Supplement Vaan using potions if too many attacks land in a row, or use a Hi-Potion if you have some to top Vaan up quickly. Repeat until you run out of resources and escape or die (death is better so that you don't have to gather resources again) or you steal the dagger and run away or die. I finally got it on my third attempt after about 75+ steals across all attempts. Your mileage and strategy may vary greatly based on your jobs, levels, resources on hand, and luck. Also, if you did manage to get the Gladius very quickly and feel lucky, you could try to take out the Lindbur Wolf for credit toward **Show Off I and II**, but it might be pushing your luck with the low levels and attacks still getting through Blind.
- ***TODO***: Definitely overhaul this explanation!

**Wolf in the Waste** (Hunts): After all of the prep for getting the Gladius from the Lindbur Wolf, I was more than ready to take on Thextera. This fight could probably be easily done at level 4 or 5 even, though the Call for Help skill will add more wolves to the fight and make this a bit more difficult. Also, Thextera will become more evasive and counter more at half health. Just heal up if HP gets low and keep the press on to win. Return to The Sandsea to report success for your reward. Also, get the next hunt (Flowering Cactoid) from the Hunt Board.
- After completing this hunt, you can find Gatsly has moved to Rabanastre: Muthru Bazaar, nearby the Clan Provisioner. Speak to them here and they'll mention that a new bazaar item is in stock for us to buy: a Forgotten Grimoire. This one, when purchased for 18,000 gil, will become the Hunter's Monograph. Purchasing your first Monograph will unlock the **Tale Of the Forgotten Grimoire** achievement. You may not have the funds to get this now (I sure didn't), but you'll get this and many others throughout the game to eventually get the **Epic of the Forgotten Grimoires** achievement.
- There are several other monographs that you can unlock as well at this point if you wish:
  - Knight's Monograph (19,000 gil): Speak to a weapon shop owner 30 times
  - Warmage's Monograph (20,000 gil): Check the Hunt Board 20 times
  - Mage's Monograph (21,000 gil): Talk to a magick shop owner 25 times
  - Dragoon's Monograph (22,000 gil): Check the Hunt Board 40 times
  - Scholar's Monograph (22,000 gil): Speak with a armor shop owner 15 times
  - Sage's Monograph (25,000 gil): Speak with any merchant 100 times
  - There is one more but is not unlockable until much later on...
  - You do not have to do these all at once or right now even. These will unlock naturally over the course of the game, but you can get them out of the way now as well, if you wish. Of course, you will definitely not be able to afford them until you are able to get more cash more readily, but having them available when you need them later could be nice.

**Dalmasca's Desert Bloom** (Hunts): The Flowering Cactoid's petitioner, Dantro, is in Dalmasca Estersand: The Output on some crates talking with a Seeq. Talk to him to start the hunt. You'll find the mark in the next area to the north, Yardang Labyrinth (https://images.steamusercontent.com/ugc/942811548910289247/11541936057BE83353922538CE5E88550DD99B5B/). Unlike other Cactoids in the vicinity, the Flowering Cactoid is more evasive and will try to run away and heal if you don't chase after it. Because of how it flees, it's a good idea to try to clear out the other fiends in the vicinity to minimize the additional encounters. If you went with having Penelo as a Black Mage, having Blind and Fire is very helpful. Blind doesn't reduce the chance of getting hit as much as it did for the Lindbur Wolf, but it can help. Fire will just do more damage and can even hit the mark as it runs off. When Flowering Cactoid has less than 20% HP remaining, it'll start to use the 1000 Needles skill which will undoubtedly kill off a party member at lower levels. Just be prepared to use a Phoenix Down right after it uses the attack so that it doesn't take out the other party member. Of course, you can save this for later in the game, but it was easy enough to accomplish with just Vaan and Penelo at level 6. If you have any Dark or Aero Motes, those can be very useful to finish off the enemy before 1000 Needles fires off as well. Return to Dantro to get the reward. Talk to him one more time to learn what to do with the Cactus Flower.

**Covered Up In Flowers/Treasure Hunter Mog** (Side Quest): Getting the Cactus Flower and talking to Dantro twice kicks off the start of these side quests. Head north to South Bank Village and talk to the Villager near the door of a house by the pier. She mentions that there is an ill villager inside. If you didn't talk to Dantro twice, you won't know that she's the one to bring the Cactus Flower to. Handing over the Cactus Flower will net you a Bundle of Needles. Speak with Dantro's Wife once again to learn that she needs Semclam Shells. You will want to get five of them in order to ensure you get the best reward. Two are in the beach water in the village and the other three are along the beach outside the village. They appear as Mysterious Glints. Bring all five back to Dantro's Wife (don't bring her any amounts lower than 5 or the quest will continue and the rewards will be worse). She'll now say that she needs Nebralim, which Dantro can help with. Go back to The Outpost again and Dantro will tell you to help yourself to the items. There are two Small Phials around the Outpost: one on an urn to the south of Dantro, the other north of Dantro on an urn next to a chocobo. Take them back to Dantro's Wife. Now she'll ask for Valeblossom Dew. This is not accessible yet, however. The rest of the quest will be finished later. This could be saved for later as well, but if you completed the Flowering Cactoid hunt, it doesn't hurt to get this fetch quest out of the way.

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: If you went through the trouble of starting the Cactus Flower/Treasure Hunter Mog side quests, you'll be rewarded with access to your second Teleport Save Crystal.

Upon returning to Old Dalan, Penelo will leave the party. Once you have the Crescent Stone and have headed into Garamsythe Waterway, I recommend making a new save file at the Save Crystal here. It'll be some time before you can return to Rabanastre once you enter the palace (the game will tell you twice that you are about to reach a point of no return) and some things will change. If you haven't accomplished some of the early game missables, an old save prior to this point will be a good spot for coming back later to clean those up.

**Show Off I** (Bestiary?): While traversing Garamsythe Waterway and entering the North Spur Sluiceway zone, you may find the Razorfin rare game here, as it has a 10% chance of spawning instead of the normal Ichthons that continually appear as you cull their numbers. If you see a larger flying fish, you'll have found it. It's probably not worth grinding for it now, given that there is a level gate approaching. However, if it appears upon entering the zone (like it did for me), feel free to take it out! It's not too tough to beat at level 7 and I imagine that level 6 or 5 might still be okay. Also, if you have the Firefly and insist on getting the rare game now, you might consider putting that on to avoid XP accumulation if your levels are getting too high.

**Cartographer** (cont'd): A green urn with the map of the Royal Palace of Rabanastre is behind Vaan as soon as you are in control after entering the area. While the achievement states that one-time areas are excluded from getting this Sky Pirate's Den statue, I'm not taking any chances (getting this map later in the game costs 100,000 gil if you miss it here). I'd be interested to know if missing this actually doesn't matter though.

### Exit Stage Right ➡️ She Airship Enough For You

***Level Cap Reminder***: The first level cap in the set is approaching soon. You must be at or under level 12 before the Mimic Queen fight.

Once you have Balthier and Fran in the party and learned about gambits, feel free to set up their jobs and use the license points they have built up from you play during the opening chapter.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: As soon as you enter Garamsythe Waterway: East Waterway Control, there is a map urn at the dead end to the left.

**New and Exciting Ways to Kill a Man** (Challenge): Our first real boss and challenge! When you reach Garamsythe Waterway: Central Waterway Control, turn off all gambits on all characters, including your guest, and then make use of the Save Crystal. The battle does not present a primed achievement indicator unfortunately. Once ready, enter the door to the north to the boss fight against Firemane. It's time to mostly fight like a traditional turn-based RPG.
- Cue up commands as they are being executed by a character. Attack will be your most frequent, for sure, but that command will auto-queue after use. If you happen to have a Water Mote, this might be a great opportunity to make use of it. If anyone has access to Blind, that can be helpful as well. As Attack commands continue, be ready to use items or Cure spells to heal up.
- When Firemane teleports, your characters will sometimes stop their actions. Find the boss to continue the battle, requeuing your Attacks, other methods of dealing damage, or do more healing.
- Want to do even MORE damage? Lure Firemane into the water on the ground in the area. Your attacks will be more effective while the water terrain effect is in place on Firemane. Thunder spells will be more effective too, though attacks should be more than enough for you.
- Firemane has HP thresholds that will trigger it's use of the Bushfire skill: 80%, 50%, and 20%. Be ready to heal up as you reach these points on the boss' health bar. Also, remove poison status with Antidotes if that lands during the Bushfire (though it seems the chance of that happening is low).
- It's probably not worth trying to steal from this boss. You are more than likely to get a Potion or Phoenix Down rather than the 3% rare steal of a Grimoire Togail. While the grimoire is needed for a bazaar item, you'll be able to get them later on.
- After you win and the scenes play out, don't forget to turn your gambits back on as characters rejoin the party!

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: After defeating the three Seeq bullies in Nalbina Dungeon: The Arena and the scenes, you'll be in Confiscatory, where you'll get your equipment back as well as the map of the location.

**Hold All the Cards** (Characters?): Once in Barheim Passage: The Lightworks, you'll find your first merchant that sells gambits. Convenient! Even better, there is a guaranteed chest that contains 2510 gil in the alcove to the right from where you first appear in the area. Buying all available gambits from the merchant costs 2000 gil. Even more convenient! These gambits will be available at other gambit shops and merchants so you certainly don't have to get them all now, but it certainly can't hurt and you probably have more than enough money to spare at this point. You probably have a lot of loot to sell as well. The journey to getting all of the gambits begins!
- Regarding getting ALL of the gambits, once the rest of them are accessible after escaping from Barheim Passage, you'll see prices range from 50-300 gil per gambit.
- Ideally, you'll want to focus on getting those that will see the most use in these beginning chapters. Don't sweat purchasing more than you need, or the rest of them, until you have too much money to know what to do with it all. This can be a late game/post game unlock.
- **Total number of gambits:** 249
- **Total cost:** 27,410 gil

**Arrive To the Mist** (Characters): This can be unlocked at any time when a character has a job license board, but I got my first one in Barheim Passage.

**Keep On the Lights** (Challenge): This starts as soon as you put in the Tube Fuse you receive from Burrogh, the merchant, into the Power Relay (initially called "Timeworn Device"). Burrogh will only give you the Tube Fuse if you first looked at the Timeworn Device. For safety, make sure you save prior to inserting the fuse so that you can retry if the power level drops below 25%.
- Once progressing through the passage, keep an eye out for Battery Mimics. These fiends will drain the Charge so they are a priority. You have your introduction to them in the very next zone: Op Sector 29. There will be a pair of them and the charge drains to 30% right away! Yikes! Take out the one draining the cables as soon as possible. In my first attempt, I was able to keep power at 27% and beat it to restore power considerably. Even just attacking it to aggro it is helpful to keep the power charge from continuing to tick down. Once the charged up Battery Mimic is dead, the charge will restore. In my second attempt (after forgetting about the one session restriction), I failed to keep it above 25%. I assume this was because the other Battery Mimic reached their conduit to drain before I could get there. So I had to reset and try yet again. I tried again to put some pressure on the second mimic before it could run downstairs but it eventually broke away and I was not able to beat the first one in time. Focus all characters on the first mimic for success. This is probably the hardest part of the challenge. If you continue to have trouble, think about making use of motes or any spells available. When I finally succeeded, I used some Dark Motes on both Battery Mimics with multiple characters to quickly take them down. If the second Battery Mimic gets away, it will run downstairs to chomp on another cable and drain power again. The game provides a notification when this happens. You should have more buffer after taking out the first one to finish up attacking the small fry before fighting the big Mimic.
- The very next zone, Great Eastern Passage, has a Battery Mimic to quickly eliminate. At the fork, take the right path to find another Battery Mimic. Double pack and take the left path. At the next fork, continue to the left for one more Battery Mimic. Head back to the fork and take the right path. You'll come to a point where two paths merge, where the path you haven't explored yet has the map urn.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: The Barheim Passage map is located in the map urn in Great Eastern Passage, in a passage to the north after making it through the forked paths with Battery Mimics.

**Keep On the Lights (cont'd)**: Proceed south from the map urn to one more Battery Mimic that enters the area from the southern exit. Take it out. Getting through these areas while knowing where the Mimics will be makes it quite easy to keep the power charge high and even topped up at 100%. Fighting the mimics is important to help boost up your charge level if it has dropped down. Here are the other locations and where the Battery Mimics can be found:
- Op Sector 36: An optional area accessible from the platform at the southern end of the Great Eastern Passage. There are two Battery Mimics here along with treasures. The first is to your right upon entering the zone and the second is down the stairs.
- Special Op Sector 3: You'll arrive here from the southern exit of the Great Eastern Passage. As you continue south, a Battery Mimic will appear from the right and run south toward more cables to chew. Return to wear it came from to find Flans blocking the path to another Battery Mimic. Use Fire to eliminate the Flans quickly then get to the Battery Mimic.
- Op Sector 37: This area contains the switch that will open the gate blocking progress through Barheim Passage. It is up the stairs from the second Battery Mimic in Special Op Sector 3. A mimic is to your left upon entering the first room of the zone. You may see a second downstairs run off as you fight the first one. Chase after it, fending off any Flans along the way and defeat it to stop the drain on the power charge. Loot treasures and then press the Gate Switchboard's button. Note that this will drain 30% charge. If your charge dropped too low before hitting the switch, you'll need to start over from your save. Return to Special Op Sector 3.
- North-South Junction: Feel free to use the Save Crystal here after the cutscenes but don't save over your slot from prior to attempting this achievement.
- Great Central Passage: Head south and check the alcove to your left for a Battery Mimic which presents a perfect opportunity to get your power charge back up again. This is the point where Mimics with do the traditional thing of pretending to be treasure chests as well.
- The Zeviah Subterrane: As soon as you enter, you'll find two Battery Mimics. One will fight you and the other will run off. This is a large area so use your map to see the glowing <!> areas that identify where the Battery Mimics will be. You are nearly at the end of this challenge!
- Terminus No. 4 Adjunct: Another Save Crystal just before an arena room. Boss fight incoming!
- Mimic Queen fight: The big issue here is balancing your attacks on the queen while also dealing with the Tiny Batteries that are draining the power charge. I used Vaan to eliminate Tiny Batteries while the others focused on the Queen. I was able to outpace its healing and spawning replacements easily. The achievement unlocks upon defeat of the Mimic Queen, as long as the power was maintained above 25% in the entire session.

**A Shocking Escape** (Challenge): When nearing the end of Barheim Passage and at the Save Crystal in the Terminus No. 4 Adjunct zone, remove Balthier and Fran from the party. You have the potential of doing this AND **Keep On the Lights** together. I was not able to because I was worried about the reaction the Mimic Queen has to killing the Tiny Batteries (it heals itself and then spawns a replacement), and that the Tiny Batteries are gnawing on cables draining the power while you focus on the Mimic Queen trying to avoid that healing reaction. I did a test after unlocking this achievement and found that I was able to succeed in keeping the charge above 25% while only having my Monk Vaan and the Guest. I would have Guest focus on the Queen while I directed Vaan manually to attack a Tiny Battery until it died. I then moved Vaan to the next one, keeping the pressure on taking out these Tiny Batteries. I was able to outpace the healing and spawning of replacements and then it seemed that Queen stopped spawning new ones once its health was lower. With that in mind, I recommend not doing this until AFTER completing **Keep On the Lights** since that requires completing in one session. With my Vaan at level 9 and the Guest at level 11, setting up gambits so that Vaan and Guest focused on the foe with the highest HP and healing an ally that goes less that 50% with a Potion, I had no issue getting this. Of course, your experience may vary depending on your selected job for Vaan and that may even impact being able to do both this and **Keep On the Lights**. Good luck!
- **New level cap**: The next boss must be defeated at or under level 15. If you are like me, your party average is probably around 10 at this point.
- ***TODO***: Fix up the above to make it read better, but I did capture everything about being able to beat this AND do **Keep On the Lights** together. The big thing to remember is that the ability to do both may be dependent on the job assigned to Vaan. Worst case, make a save, prioritize finishing **Keep On the Lights**, then reload the save and do this achievement after word.

**Sister's Path** (Side Quest): This is a missable achievement because the responses given will determine the reward which could lock you out of getting the required Runeblade. You can start this quest as soon as you return to Rabanastre after the Mimic Queen fight. Ktjn, a Viera, will ask you questions throughout the progress of the story and you'll want to respond appropriately to get the best award. She will be found in Muthru Bazaar sitting on the stair railing leading up to North End. Talk to her twice to get her first question. It beings with "Is the city not wonderful?" and ends with "Should this not trouble me as a viera?" Respond with "Yes, you should be ashamed" to set you on the path toward the Runeblade. Seems like an awful thing to say though...

**Game Breaker** (Challenge? Treasure?): This is the earliest point in which the Seitengrat is available to find. The Aerodrome is now open with flights going to Nalbina. This bow is ridiculously overpowered, is in a chest that is invisible, and the contents of the invisible chest can rarely be the weapon. The power of the bow and the lack of requirement to have a license to equip it is why it is excluded for most of the boss challenges. It does NOT seem to be prevented for use in hunts, however...
- Obtaining it easily requires immense luck or RNG manipulation. RA's Agnam has a video that shows how to obtain it with consistency. It's wild! The volume on it is very low so you'll need to turn it up. Also, it requires starting from the Bhujerba Aerodrome, so we'll wait to get it once we're there.

**Hold All the Cards (cont'd)**: All gambits should now be available in the gambit shop in Rabanastre. They are much more expensive at this point so you won't be able to get them all now, more than likely. Just pick up what you need for now. You'll be able to get the rest as you please throughout the game.

### She Airship Enough For You ➡️ Proof of Royal Lineage

***Level Cap Reminder***: Next level cap is 15 for the boss fight in the Lhusu Mines! Note that your guest character's level in this dungeon is not applicable (they leave before the fight).

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: After arriving in Bhujerba, you'll find a Teleport Save Crystal nearby. Interact with it to add it to the list. Because of the urgency of the visit here, you can't use it to teleport right now anyway.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: You'll find a Cartographer's Guild moogle at the top of the stairs on the path leading away from the Aerodrome. You can buy maps of Bhujerba and Lhusu Mines for them to complete these areas for 720 gil.

**Show Off I (cont'd)**: As you head through the Lhusu Mines and pass through Oltam Span, you have a 20% chance of encountering Aerieel, a rare game version of the Steeling that spawn here. Feel free to defeat it if it shows up as it is fairly easy to defeat despite the level 16 cap for the **I Will Have My Pound of Flesh** challenge. Of course, after doing that challenge, the cap will raise to 22 so you have even more room if you have some difficulty. In any case, just have everyone attack the Aerieel and it will drop fairly quickly.

**The Unrelenting** (Sky Pirate's Den): In the Lhusu Mines is a popular location to rack up chain and unlock Montblanc's statue in the Sky Pirate's Den. If you are too close to the level cap, definitely hold off on this. At Lhusu Mines: Shunia Twinspan are a ton of Skeletons and Skull Defenders. You can very quickly reach a 50-chain in the location by slowly going through to encourage these enemies to spawn, fighting them to build chain, and running up and down the span to encourage as many enemies as possible to spawn. When finished, run back two zones to Oltam Span and back to Shunia Twinspan to respawn the enemies and do it again. Just make sure to hold R2 for Escaping Mode so that you avoid any enemies that may have respawned in Transitway 1. This is a great spot to quickly get license points too, if you need them. Just make sure you have someone keeping Libra up so that you can identify traps.
- As a metric, I was level 10 on average when going into this zone. I was level 12 average when I unlocked **The Unrelenting**.

**Blood Dancer** (Sky Pirate's Den): There is a good chance that you could get Basch's statue while working on the 50-chain as well. If not, you are probably really close unless you've been keeping your levels really low. Nevertheless, this one will come naturally over the course of the game anyway.

**I Will Have My Pound of Flesh** (Challenge): If you are interested in collecting the treasures in this area, such as the Assassin's Dagger if you have a Hunter, make sure to get them before going to the boss fight. Once Ba'Gamnan is defeated, the chests permanently despawn in Site 2. Okay, as for strategy, make sure to keep your health up. Modify your gambits if you need to to have one character focused on healing while the other two fight the henchmen first before fighting Ba'Gamnan. I'd focus on Gijuk first, since they're hasted at the start of the battle and is the opposing party's spellcaster. Then take out Bwagi and Rinok. Finally knock out Ba'Gamnan. If you have any quickening available at this point, this is a great time to bust them out to help reduce their numbers and HP. If you chain a few or more, you'll certainly get at least Inferno as the Area of Effect followup. Just keep an eye on HP and ensure gambits are throwing Potions if anyone gets too low or you are manually doing so. If you have mages, expect Ba'Gamnan and lackeys to silence them so a White Mage character may lose their ability to cast Cure. Use Echo Herbs as needed to recover from that as well. Also, don't forget the Motes you've no doubt accumulated! This gang of Bangaa are weak to water but Dark Motes could also be of help. Your Black or Red Mage could have the Water spell from the Bhujerba magick shop and their license is unlocked. If you have a Dispel Mote, you could remove the buffs on one of them as well (preferably Ba'Gamnan). You don't have to worry about gaining levels during this fight as the bosses do not give XP, only LP.
- What I did: I set gambits to have Vaan and Basch use Potions when anyone was less that 50% HP while Balthier would cast Cure when anyone was less that 70% HP. Vaan would target the foe with the lowest HP (which would be the lackeys, especially after using Quickenings) while the others targeted Vaan's target as the party leader. One other gambit I put on Basch was using Hi-Potions when an ally went below 30% HP, as a backup to curing in an emergency. My party was an average of level 12. I focused my Quickening on Gijuk first to take him out and drop the HP of the other two lackeys. If you are quick, you could potential hit Ba'Gamnan with the followup area of effect as well to get a start on knocking down his HP! Rinok was my next target because their Jump attack is pretty damaging at this low level. Once you have two down, the fight becomes much more manageable. I was probably making the fight a bit more difficult by having Balthier in my party since the bangaa like to focus on him, but it worked out in the end.
- **New level cap**: The next boss must be defeated at level 22 or less. Keep in mind that you will have a guest join for the boss that will be at a higher level than the party (average level of the two highest level characters + 4 levels).

**Raise a Clamor** (Challenge): Fun... this starts right as you leave the mines. There is opportunity to save, but make it quick! There is no timer shown, only the primed achievement indicator. If you need to pause and figure out a path, use the emulator's pause function to halt things. Note that using L1 to speed up the game does not increase the speed of the timer (I assume the achievement logic is using the in-game timer to determine if 100 seconds has elapsed). However, I'd recommend only using that when walking a straight line and be ready to turn it off if you need finer control of your movement. The best people to press the Square button next to are the City Parijanah (the people with the blue books in their hands that help you learn about the city).
- To accomplish this, I used [RedrumOverdose](https://retroachievements.org/user/RedrumOverdose)'s route for the most part as well as the recommendation to use the save to take my time to learn the route before executing it again while in double speed mode. Use the [maps](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1292596668) to learn the names and layouts of the streets that you'll be running through as well.
- As soon as you start, press square near the shopkeeper by the exit of Lhusu Square, then head out the exit to Miner's End.
- At the Y intersection, press Square at the Parijanah that is at the center point of the Y. Then run out the other end of the Y that leads to the Cloudborne Row zone.
- This is a great spot to double speed. Run through Cloudborne Row to the intersection, take the north route to another intersection where another Parijanah awaits. I was at around 59% at this point. Head east and loop around to near the ramp that leads out of the zone for yet another Parijanah, putting me up to 71%.
- The next zone is Travica Way, and you'll come up behind the Cartographer's Guild moogle from when you first arrived in Bhujerba, along with another Parijanah. If you were quick and are close to both of these NPCs, pressing Square here will get you to 100%. If you still need a little bit more, quickly head south to the weapon shop entrance when one more Parijanah waits to get that final push.
- Some potential pitfalls:
  - When entering a new zone, it may take a bit for NPCs to load. Make sure you aren't standing where they will appear or they won't load in until you move away.
  - While in double speed, the meter will drop quicker than with it off. Only use double speed when you can make quick, straight movements or you have the path more or less memorized.
  - I experienced an instance near the end where pressing Square started a conversation with an NPC rather than cause Vaan to shout. This was because the meter for the interaction hadn't loaded in yet. I'm not playing with Fast CDVD Loading on so maybe that was why it happened. If it happens to you, quickly press the Circle button to get out of the conversation and press Square again to shout.

**The Sky Sisters** (Side Quest): If you want to do the Seitengrat RNG manipulation, you'll need to have at least traveled in the passenger airships at least once as there is a cutscene that will play when you first board one that can affect your RNG position. So, this is a perfect time to kick off the Sky Sisters quest. To do so, board one of the flights and go speak to the Chief Steward. If it is Ann, she'll be hounded by a person named Rande, who seems to think you are some sort of rival love interest. This can be started at any time and you can't finish the quest yet, but if you are going for the Seitengrat, you may as well kick this off while trying to get past the initial flight cutscene.

**Game Breaker (cont'd)**: The Bhujerba Aerodrome is now open for business. If you want to go for the Seitengrat, this is the best opportunity to do so, based on the video created by [Agnam](https://retroachievements.org/user/Agnam). You can also check out [a video by Roostalol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyjzj_cN6Ic) that provides a bit more context on how this RNG manipulation works. Good luck and may the RNG be in your favor, manipulated or otherwise.
- Again, reminder that the volume for the Agnam's explanation is quite low, so make sure to turn your volume back down once you have listened to their explanation and try it out in-game. Roostalol is much louder so if you are having a hard time, use that video instead.
- Get the [RNG Helper application](https://github.com/blakehartley/RNGHelper) that is shown in the video. Unfortunately, this may be only for Windows systems. Hopefully there is a similar application out there for other platforms or this one may already work in Linux (Android devices might be out of luck unless someone ports it over some day or you have a PC or something that can run it...).
  - Another option is to use [Mark Egli's RNG Cure List website](https://markegli.com/ff12/) which displays the cure values and percentages that the RNG Helper application does and allows you to provide cure values to find your position. The only thing this doesn't really provide is indication for when you are going to combo if you attack yourself.
- Have a save file from the prologue with Reks and a file at Bhujerba Aerodrome. Your save at Bhujerba Aerodrome should have done at least one passenger flight already to avoid the unskippable cutscene that will play once you are on your maiden voyage.
- By default, the Character Stats section is already filled out with Reks' stats. Double check it. If it is different, update the values in the RNG Helper application, close the game and restart it, loading the Reks save one more time.
- Ensure your Chest 1 settings are as follows:
  - Appears Chance: 1
  - RNG Position: 154
  - Gil Chance: 80
  - Item 1 Chance: 95
  - Gil Amount: 100
- Set the "Consume" text box to 11.
- The overall goal is to get your RNG position to 544. You advance the RNG position by one when you cast Cure. You advance the position by 11 when you attack yourself (called "Consume" in RNG Helper).
- I am assuming that you are using PCSX2. I'm not familiar with other PS2 emulators and can't speak to their experience.
- If you have the game open, close it. You should be at PCSX2's game selection screen. Start up Final Fantasy XII: IZJS and load your Reks save that I told you to keep.
- Tell Reks to cast Cure on himself. Record the value of HP restored in the "Last heal" text box and press the Start button on RNG Helper.
- For continued casts of Cure, update the value of HP restored in "Last heal" if it doesn't match and press the Continue button.
- As you press Continue, the RNG position table will update to where it thinks you are at based on the Cure values you provide it. If you are far away from RNG position 544, have Reks attack himself and press the Consume button for each successful attack to advance the position by 11 spots. If I got a combo hit or a block, that seemed to mess up my RNG position and I needed to start the search over again. I wouldn't reset the whole thing, I'd just use the new unexpected heal value and press the Start button to start a new search. Make use of the Save Crystal as needed to restore HP and MP as you do this. Once you think you have your RNG position confirmed, use Cure again to verify that the number of HP gained matches what is shown in the "Last heal" text box.
- If you have Reks attack himself when the "Combo after punch #" value says "0", Reks will combo himself and either die or throw off your RNG position. So if you see a 0 there, use Cure magic to get past that RNG position rather than attack.
  - One funny bit in Agnam's video is when Reks combos himself. If that happens to you, unfortunately you'll have to start over again. I hope that is a rare occurrence and Agnam's reaction suggests that it is.
  - Having Fast CDVD Loading on seems to affect the starting RNG position. If your starting position is above 544, toggle your Fast CDVD Loading setting in PCSX2 and try again.
  - In my own personal struggles with this, I was constantly finding Reks blocking after a chain of cures and attacks which would completely throw off my RNG tracking because I don't know how much a block consumes, but it DOES consume because my Cure values would no longer be tracking the same. So, after starting with Cures to find my starting position, I would have Reks attack himself for as long as I could, using the Save Crystal when health got low enough, until I got close to the 544 position or the "Combo after punch #" value said "0". Then I would Cure the rest of the way.
- The green rows on the table are the RNG positions used. So, you are looking for the last green row to be Position 544, meaning that the very next position will be 545, which is what will net you the Seitengrat.
  - The last four Cure values you should see is 91, 88, 95, 87. If you see that string of four values, you are set to continue.
- Once at the correct position, pause the game by pressing Start on your controller and Quit to Title by pressing the Square button and confirming.
- Now you will be loading your Aerodrome save and performing specific actions quickly. I will leave that part to the videos so you can see how Agnam positions Vaan and the quickness of the actions. It'd be hard to explain here in text, but I will try. If it doesn't work, practice makes perfect. Try to mimic the actions in the videos and then try again if it doesn't work.
  - As soon as select your Bhujerba Aerodrome save, hold up-left on the stick to run toward the desk where the Flights to Rabanastre attendant will load in. Stand slightly away from the desk so that the attendant will actually load (too close and they won't appear).
  - Turn the camera so that you are looking back at the Teleport Save Crystal, the attendant's desk to your left, and the center of the walkway. As soon as the City Parijanah loads in the center of the path, pause the game for about 10 seconds or so (some say 3-4 seconds, I paused longer) to ensure that the attendant loaded in.
  - Hold the left stick in the direction of the desk, unpause, and spam the Circle button until your flight is confirmed and the screen goes black.
  - Quickly skip the cutscene of the airship departing.
  - Continue to mash Circle while holding up on the left stick as the Chief Steward talks to you over a black screen.
  - As the scene on the sky ferry's Observation Parlor comes into view, you'll be moving up the stairs. Take a left and continue up the next step of stairs, turning the camera to follow behind Vaan.
  - Once against the door that leads outside to the Air Deck, continue walking forward and press Circle to open the door on the second step. This delay to open the door is critical to ensuring that the invisible chest appears.
    - This is one of the hardest parts of this whole thing, in my opinion. Take care to pay close attention to the steps. Too early or too late can move the RNG position out of where it is needed to spawn the Seitengrat chest.
  - Hold up-left on the left stick to go around the wall to get to some stairs. Head up the stairs long the center and keep walking until you, hopefully, run into an invisible chest.
  - Position Vaan next to the chest and equip the Diamond Armlet if not already equipped.
  - Begin to observe two NPCs: a person walking around in a green tank top, and a person walking up and down the stairs you just climbed that is in red and black clothes. The behavior of these NPCs will help you time opening the invisible chest to guarantee the Seitengrat:
    - The red NPC must go up and down the stairs twice. When they descend the second time, now you will keep your eyes on the green NPC.
    - The green NPC will come to a stop of the lower right corner of the emblem on the ground. They will then turn away from you and walk toward the upper right corner of the emblem. On that NPC's 3rd step, press Circle to open the invisible chest. That should be your Seitengrat! Have fun breaking the game, if you wish.
- One thing to not forget (which I kept forgetting...) is that you make sure Vaan has the Diamond Armlet equipped. You can do this on the ferry airship while standing next to the chest if you wish. If you don't equip it, the chest will spawn but it will give you a Knot of Rust instead.
- Finally, once you have obtained Seitengrat, you will have one of the four items toward the **Zodiac's Hidden Gifts** achievement.

**The Cry of Its Power/No One Likes My Pets, Kupo...** (Hunts/Side Quest): If you got the Rocktoise quest from Montblanc, you can find Pilika in Bhujerba: Skygrounds to accept the quest. If your levels are low, especially for the Ba'Gamnan level cap, it may be a bit tough to defeat this right away. You could grind a bit in Lhusu Mines as you make your way toward Site 2 for the hunt, but keep the next level cap of 22 in mind and that you will have some fights coming up after your meeting with the Marquis. Rocktoise is level 16, so around there should be a good target.
- General strategy:
  - Set up a traditional party composition of tank, DPS, and healer. A White or Red Mage can serve well as healer casting Cure or Cura with its area of effect, or just someone set up to chuck Potions like crazy. The tank will provide backup on healing with Potions and should be your character with the most HP, such as a Knight character. Finally, your DPS, the main damage dealer, should be your fastest character, such as Vaan as a Hunter or Monk who can attack multiple times per round. Any combination will work though and feel free to experiment.
  - Get the tank up to Rocktoise as the primary attack to draw its aggro toward the tank. Meanwhile, your healer's gambits should be set up for them to be slinging cure spells or Potions/Hi-Potions frequently. The healer should also be prepared to recover any status effects on the party (if you don't have gambit slots, just issue the commands manually). Finally, your DPS will be primarily attacking with their gambit setup, typically by targeting the foe the tank/party leader is attacking.
  - Rocktoise will start increasing its attack frequency when around 30-20% HP remaining. This is a perfect time to unleash quickenings to deplete the remaining health.
- Once defeated, return to Pilika to get your reward and complete the hunt, awarding **The Cry of Its Power**. Talk to the moogle again to start the side quest, where they hand you a Merchant's Armband. No matter what you decide to do while retrieving the diary they ask you to get, respond with "I've done nothing." to Pilika to get the better prize and the **No One Likes My Pets, Kupo...** achievement.

**Marauder in the Mines** (Hunts): You can also take this hunt on as you head into the mines to defeat the Rocktoise if you wish. Talk to Aekom near the mine entrance to start the hunt.
- Nidhogg will be at Lhusu Mines: Transitway 1 near the main split path. You'll probably see the giant blue snake as soon as you enter the zone. Using the Tank, DPS, Healer combo will continue to aid you here. Note that the healer may have trouble keeping up with Cure spells if that is all that's available so supplement by the tank using Hi-Potions or Potions. It's also a good idea to have a gambit for treating poison, though if you don't have the slots available, feel free to manually use Antidotes.
- Nidhogg is weak to Fire! You probably have the Fire spell, AND you may even have the Oil spell! Make use of that weakness and the 3x damage boost from Oil.
- As with other hunt monsters, Nidhogg will increase attack frequency, physical power, physical defense, and speed as it's HP gets low.
- After your victory and talking to Aekom again, the Seeq will give you a Great Serpentskin. This item is needed for the **Covered Up In Flowers/Treasure Hunter Mog** quests! DO NOT SELL IT!!!

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: After going to see the Marquis and a bunch of cutscenes, you'll be onboard the Leviathan, receiving the map of the area.

**Spellsinger** (Sky Pirate's Den): I unlocked it while onboard Dreadnought Leviathan but you mileage will vary depending on how much you are using spells.

### Proof of Royal Lineage ➡️ Power of Dawn

***Level Cap Reminder***: Level 22 for the next boss. You will have a guest and they will join at a higher level than you (average level of the two highest level characters + 4 levels).

**Tale of the Forgotten Grimoire** (Inventory? Side Quest?): When you buy your first Forgotten Grimoire from the bazaar, this will unlock. I happened to buy my first one after doing a bit of grinding of skeletons in the Lhusu Mines after the events on the Dreadnought Leviathan and selling the loot. 

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: After checking in with the Marquis and the cutscenes that follow, you'll be at Dalmasca Westersand: The Western Divide. Touch the Teleport Save Crystal to register a new teleport spot.

**Sister's Path (cont'd)**: After leaving Bhujerba finally, ready to head to Raithwall's Tomb, you can return to Rabanastre to respond to the next thing  discusses. To stay on the path toward the Runeblade, when Ktjn says, "I knew my choice would bring hardship, yet...", respond with "You should've thought it through."

**Of the Highest Grade!** (Side Quest): I hadn't done the Cluckatrice hunt yet so I made my way back to Giza Plains and the giant dusk crystals were shining again. Talking to Masyua will let you charge up a new sunstone. All you need to do is go around to the shining dusk crystals again (marked on your map as well). When you charge your sunstone, the dusk crystal goes dark and the opposite crystal on the other side of the plains will light up. You can either circle around the zones to charge your sunstone to 100%, or you can go back and forth between two alternating stones. Either way, once at 100%, return to Masyua again and give the sunstone to her to get the reward and the achievement. As the description states, make sure you have the room for the reward. I assume this is due to how the set developer determined that the sunstone was fully charged.

**Little Love on the Big Plains** (Hunts): The Cluckatrice and its three Chickatrices are a tough fight at lower levels. I waited until after Bhujerba so that I could have higher levels, better weapons and armor, and more skills to work with before the fight. To get the mark to appear, you must clear out all of the fiends in Giza Plains: Gizas North Bank. Once done, leave the zone (if you go back to the village you can save just before hand) and return to find one of the Chickatrices. If you attack it, the Cluckatrice and other chicks will join in on the fight!
- First thing prior to engaging is to ensure that you have adequate defenses on your tank and make sure that they engage first. If you are using a spellcaster, make sure that you don't use Aero type spells if you have them. They are weak to Earth spells, but you may not have them this early. With all of these enemies, expect to be taking a ton of damage quickly. Make sure you have a dedicated healer.
- Quickenings can be very useful. Once all of the marks are gathered around, let loose! I would recommend targeting the Cluckatrice since it has the most HP. Getting a decent chain could nearly or completely take it out and do decent damage to the chicks to make wiping them up easy.
- The Cluckatrice can cause a variety of status ailments. If you have unlocked Remedy Lore licenses, you probably have a few vials of Remedy by now to clear up Petrify or Slow statuses.
- The Cluckatrice will attack much more quickly at less than 20% health so if the quickenings and follow up Concurrence doesn't eliminate it, finish the job quickly.
- Of course, you may have Seitengrat by now as well. I won't mention it any more after this, but there is no restriction for using it with the Hunts. So, feel free to go wild with it, I guess. 🤷‍♂️
- After turning in the hunt results and getting the reward (and achievement), sell the Rainbow Egg to unlock a Hi-Potion Pack in the bazaar. A worthy investment!

**Waterway Haunting** (Hunts): After returning to The Sandsea and getting the job for the Wyvern Lord before heading toward Raithwall's Tomb, I noticed I forgot to get the Wraith hunt done. So, I went to knock that out quickly while I was in the area as well.
- You''ll find the petitioner Milha in Lowtown: North Sprawl hunched down by a door to a Residence. Talk to them to start the hunt.
- In Lowtown's Storeroom 5, take the east door down to Garamsythe Waterway: Overflow Cloaca to find the Wraith. Watch out for status effects, use Fire or Thunder if available, and use traditional tank, healer, DPS roles to easily take this mark down. The particular status it will use the most is Doom but it has a chance of missing your party, especially if you decide to do this at a higher level like I did. Counter Doom by reviving anyone that dies from it and cycle your characters if you need to in order to make sure at least someone is alive if Phoenix Downs or the Raise spell are somehow not available.
- Head back to Lowtown and talk to Milha again to get your reward, complete the hunt, and get the achievement.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: After the cutscene upon entering Ogir-Yensa Sandsea, you'll find two map urns at the top of the ramp to the first platform.

**Show Off I (cont'd)**: The rare game Pineapple has a 20% chance of spawning in Ogir-Yensa Sandsea: Platform 1 - Refinery. If you happen to come across it, you should be able to defeat it without too much issue but it may be better to come back later on to avoid getting levels too high grinding for it at this time. 
- Additionally, the Urutan Exile appears in Platform 2 - Refinery if you have a 100 kills of Urutan-Yensa enemies without leaving the Ogir-Yensa region or touching a Save Crystal! This will definitely net you a ton of experience so if you have a gap in levels until reaching the level 22 cap, you might want to try for this as well. Just keep an eye on your levels, especially Vossler, and use Firefly accessories if needed or wait until later on.
  - Going for this rare game now, despite the level 22 cap for the upcoming boss, is probably a good idea as it will help you get your levels closer to the cap so that you have better chances of winning the fight and the grind of 100 enemies will be more convenient to do now.
  - Chain isn't required, but it can certainly help in keeping track of the number as well as ensuring you meet the requirements of not touching a Save Crystal or leaving the region.
    - If you do have the max chain level before the fight, you'll have a higher chance of the Urutan Exile dropping the Magoroku katana, which is much more powerful at this point of the game than other weapons currently available (18% chance versus 5% with no chain).
  - The Primary Tank Complex zone will probably be the ideal location to build up chain on Urutan-Yensa. Just be cautious of the Salamand Entite that likes to roam around the center platforms. Turn off spell gambits around it!
- After all the Urutan-Yensa grinding, I got dangerously close to exceeding level 22 on Vossler. Be wary of your guest characters!!

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: Another Teleport Save Crystal can be found at Ogir-Yensa Sandsea: Yensa Border Tunnel in the southwest corner of the region.

**Plunderer** (Sky Pirate's Den): When you unlock this achievement and the Penelo statue in the Den will undoubtedly vary but selling loot and finding chests with gil will get you to 100,000 gil accumulated over the course of the game easily. Note that you do NOT need to have that amount on hand all at once. The game tracks how much you have earned.

**Covered Up In Mist** (Characters?): Another achievement that can be unlocked at varying times for different people based on their progression through the License Board. I got my achievement with Vaan's Monk board while opening paths to the Phoenix Lore and White Magic 9 licenses, along with the cheap spot to the right of the starting point. Ideally, you will want to maximize license board slots exposed so when unlocking quickenings rather than just grabbing the first three slots along the way. Pace yourself to ensure you are unable to unlock the most potential licenses on your characters' boards.

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: Touch the Teleport Save Crystal after defeating Garuda to register this new teleport spot.

**Better Decide Fast** (Challenge): You must get to Raithwall's Tomb with all characters, including your guest, at level 22 or less. If you do have Seitengrat, do not use it, of course.
- This is associated with the first Demon Wall you encounter. Not the other one that you'd fight if you run from the first. Note that the primed achievement indicator will appear if you meet the requirements as soon as you use the teleport way stone to enter the interior of the tomb.
- Probably the biggest key to doing this fight quickly enough is Vossler. Use his Expose technick to lower the Demon Wall's defense. I would save Traveler for the next boss fight.
- You may not have Holy, which is Demon Wall's weakness, but it is susceptible to Oil and combining that with Fire spells will do some damage as well (as long as it didn't spawn with Reflect, which it has a 50% chance of doing).
- Quickenings will also be a great tool of course, though having more slots unlocked will do more to make this faster. If all of your party members have mist slots, rotate out the standby party to throw out their quickenings as well if you need.
- This Demon Wall can use the spell Telega after it takes four actions. This will banish one random character for the remainder of the fight. Make use of the quickenings prior to this happening. Rotate in new party members to replace those banished as needed.
- Demon Wall will also use Annul on the party member with the most MP, which will likely be a magic user. If you are trying to use Fire on an Oil-soaked Demon Wall, that form of DPS will be lost unless you have Ethers. It'll occasionally Silence magic casting characters as well.
- Raising the battle speed to the fastest setting will ensure more attacks by your party (as well as Demon Wall) but the enemy will still move forward at the same speed.
- I was able to defeat the boss before it reached the third set of torches by hitting the boss with Expose, using quickenings with Basch, Fran, and Balthier, continuing to attack until the first Telega was cast (which eliminated Vossler), and then swapping to Vaan, Penelo, and Ashe to chain their quickenings. With both sets of quickenings, I hit 10+ chain and had the Torrent concurrence. Luck obviously plays a role in getting Mist Charges during the chain so be ready with that R2 button to shuffle and get new Mist Charges during the chain to keep it going. I didn't have my battle speed turned up (it was at the default) because I didn't think of it until after the fact. My wall spawned with Reflect so I didn't notice it until I cast Oil and it reflected onto Basch so I was forced into using only physical attacks and the quickenings.
- **New level cap**: Level 25 for two bosses. Both bosses are not too far off... The big problem here is that Vossler is in your party and cannot be put on the bench so if he was close to or at level 22 at the Demon Wall, he could potentially hit level 25 by the required fight. He may not exceed it, but it could be a close call. Keep an eye on his XP in the Status screen and maybe knock him out if he hits level 25.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: After defeating the second Demon Wall and the cutscene that follows in the Royal Passage zone, you'll find a map urn near three Way Stones.

**Show Off I (cont'd)**: In the Royal Passage is a rare game called Barmuu that will appear near the map urn if you chain 12 enemies (easiest would be the Seekers in the area). You should be able to achieve this chain while running back and forth picking up the guaranteed chests with the Dispel and Vanish magicks.

**Show Off I (cont'd)**: Meanwhile, in the Southfall Passage zone, a Cultsworn Lich has a chance of spawning when a Lich divides at critical health. If you don't encounter it now while traveling through the area, perhaps hold off to find it until later on when level caps are no longer a concern.

**Beast My Guest** (Challenge): An interesting challenge idea here. Fight the Esper with only Vossler and all gambits off while the main party members can only throw Potions to heal up. When you enter the Cloister of Flame, you'll have a cutscene about the concentration of Mist in the area. If you don't see the primed achievement indicator, leave the room, turn off gambits on everyone (including Vossler), and reenter the room to ensure the indicator is on prior to the fight. Since gambits are off, you'll be manually managing everything, just like with Firemane.
- Just like with the optional Demon Wall, Vossler's technicks are the key to this fight. Use Wither and Expose to lower Belias' strength and defense and should be used immediately. If you haven't made use of Traveler yet, use it now to take out a ton of HP (or save it for just before 50% HP to take out the rest of it without dealing with Belias' additional abilities later). If you did use Traveler run some laps around the Cloister of Flame while in double speed to quickly get more steps. Otherwise, just attack physically! You can use the Scathe Mote (or any other attack items) that you got from defeating the optional Demon Wall as well. If you happen to have a Hastega Mote, that could be a boon for you as well.
- The second half of the fight is kicked off by Belias using the Greater Barrier skill to reduce damage it takes followed by Firaja which will do around 300-400 HP to all characters and possibly add the Oil status. If Vossler gets Oil, make sure he uses a Handkerchief to remove it or the follow up Fire spells from Belias will quickly drop his HP.
- If you need to swap out party members for some reason, make sure to ADD a party member before removing! The achievement tracks if you have less that 3 party members in action, even while in the menu, and will disable the achievement if that happens.
- Since the other party members can only use Potions, throw them judiciously at Vossler to keep him alive. Before the fight, look at your license board and unlock any Potion Lore licenses for your jobs if available to help increase their effectiveness. Make sure you have a full stock of Potions as well! Leave the tomb to restock if necessary. Party members can die freely and then you can swap in new one to keep the Potions flowing, just be careful doing so as described above. I had 89 in my inventory before the fight but I left to go save and get the remaining 10, just in case. Dyce, the merchant you meet in the Sandsea will be at the tomb's entrance to buy more supplies. By the end of the fight, I had used 55 Potions.
- Keeping your other party members alive to throw potions is secondary, since you have three backup characters. However, it may be a good idea to have the highest HP party members out initially. If everyone is alive, that's more License Points for them all.
- ***NOTE***: I apparently misunderstood and didn't realize that Vossler could still have gambits on until I got to the Tiamat fight for **Beast My Guest II**. Whoops!
- **NOTE**: All Beast My Guest achievements require characters to do no actions other than throw potions. This includes counterattacking! If you wear an accessory like the Battle Harness and the character wearing counterattacks, that will invalidate the attempt at this achievement.

**A Song of Ice and Fire** (Challenge): A boss challenge later in the game involves going into the fight with Mateus using one character and Belias. Think about who you want to assign Belias to ahead of time (or even wait until just before the fight) so that you can decide which character would work best with your job, skills, and equipment.

**Privateer** (Sky Pirate's Den): I got this while stocking up on Potions and selling loot at Raithwall's Tomb. Selling at least 1000 loot will unlock the Migelo statue in the Den.

**Seething Mist** (Challenge): This fight requires that we have Fran in the party and don't use our new summon, any quickenings, and no deaths. Everyone should still be less than level 25 as well if you skipped back to the entrance after getting the Dawn Shard.
- When you leave The Tomb of Raithwall, make sure to put Fran in your active party and use the Save Crystal just before hand in case things go awry. The challenge here is that Fran is berserk because of the Mist. If Fran is very strong or a DPS, she may push Vossler into the second half of the fight quickly, so make sure to take care of the additional enemies quickly.
- Once the fight starts, successfully steal from the boss with any of your other teammates (the three additional swordman with him don't have to be stolen from). If all the conditions are right and you successful steal, the primed achievement marker will appear.
- The hardest part will be the second half of the fight. Vossler will maintain Reflect on himself and will more frequently combo. I'd recommend shifting from Cure to Cura, if you have it, to keep up with the damage that Vossler will deal to one person. If the fight has gone on long, Fran's berserk will drop off and she can provide support again.
- **New level cap**: Two future bosses must be defeated with an accompanying guest character below level 30. Ensure levels stay low enough that the guest does not join with their level too high (average level of the two highest level characters + 2 levels).

### Power of Dawn ➡️ A Pleasant Lie That

***Level Cap Reminder***: Level 30 for the next two bosses. You will have a guest character for both of these fights and they will join at a higher level than your party (average level of the two highest level characters + 2 levels).

**Thief of the Sand Falls/Passage of Death** (Treasure/Steal/Poach): After the events that result in the **Power of Dawn** achievement and you regain control in Rabanastre, the primed achievement marker appears for **Passage of Death**. However, BOTH of these achievements must be earned prior to seeing the Garif War-chief. The **Thief of the Sand Falls** primes only in the room that they can spawn in at Zertinan Caverns. So keep both of these in mind before events that require speaking to the Garif War-chief.

**A Scream from the Sky** (Hunts): The Wyvern Lord is in Nam-Yensa Sandsea: Simoon Bluff, an optional area with some good gear on top of this mark. You could do the fight before The Tomb of Raithwall (and Vossler will be helpful with his Telekinesis technick) but if levels are close to cap, like mine was, you may want to wait until afterword. There are a lot of other enemies in the region that will like to butt in while fighting the Wyvern Lord and their experience points may push you over. As for the fight, you'll want to use characters that can hit airborne enemies: ranged fighters, magic users, and pole or spear wielders. Quickenings can help as well. If you don't have a lot of ranged attackers, make one that can't hit a tank using Decoy to avoid the mark from picking on your magic users. Sleep is a good status effect as well. Set up a party of magic casters and one with a gambit that casts Sleep whenever it wears off and you'll stun lock this fiend until it's dead. Just don't cast Aero or you'll heal it.

**Sister's Path (cont'd)**: With the Dawn Shard in hand, Ktjn has a new question to for you. Return to her spot on the stairs at Muthru Bazaar. After a bit of conversation, she asks, "I would be as she is. Do you think it is possible?" You will want to respond "It'll never happen" in order to get the Runeblade. Only one more question remains...

**Thief of the Sand Falls** (Treasure?): Exit Rabanastre at Westgate and go through Dalmasca Westersand to the entrance to Zertinan Caverns. Once inside, you'll want to just run from everything, making your way to the Sandfalls zone. Head immediately south to Hourglass Basin and hit the boulder to continue. Run past the Buers to the south exit that leads to a seeming dead end in The Undershore zone. Upon entering, you'll see the primed achievement indicator. There is a passage to the east of the Save Crystal that isn't on the map, between two sand falls. Make a u-turn to the right to where a chest with the Thief's Cuffs has a 25% chance of spawning. There is an exit on this side of the sand falls to the north that is convenient for rezoning to try to get the chest to spawn. If you didn't save at the Save Crystal, you could reload an earlier save if you don't want to keep the accessory for now, or just run again through the Buers and other enemies back out the exit to the Westersand.

**Calm the Sandstorm** (Side Quest): Talk to Rimzat, a bangaa near the exit to the Westersand in Rabanastre: Westgate, and agree to help an investigation into the sandstorm at Wyrm's Nest. You'll need to speak to Cotze, a hume sitting on the fountain in Southern Plaza. Now head to Lowtown, just south of Storehouse 5 to speak to Northon, a hume crouched speaking with a bangaa. Now you know where one part of the windvane you need for the storm is located. We will get to the rest of this quest later.

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: If you haven't been to Nalbina Town yet, now's the time to do so in preparation for completing a later side quest. Touch the Teleport Save Crystal here to register the teleport spot.

**Chocobo Past** (Side Quest): You can only start this quest now at Nalbina Town, between the events at The Tomb of Raithwall and Mt. Bur-Omisace. Right by the Teleport Save Crystal is July, a hume crouching behind a stone and looking at two imperial guards. Talk to her. Next, approach the guards she's listening to. All this talk about chocobos and a stall right near by... Rent a chocobo from the stall and ride toward the imperial guards. That's the quest! You'll get the reward and achievement later on when you see July again in Archadies. You also now have access to the Mosphoran Highwaste and a backdoor to the Valeblossom Dew that you need.

**Covered Up In Flowers/Treasure Hunter Mog (cont'd)**: If you are continuing on from the **Chocobo Past** event and still have the chocobo you rented, it'll make getting through Mosphoran Highwaste to Dalmasca Estersand much easier since the enemies here are probably too tough. Take the northwest exit into Summit Path and follow the left wall until you reach the exit to the Estersand. This is the Broken Sands, where you'll find the Valeblossom Dew that Dantro's Wife needs. You will have to dismount the chocobo in order to get the items. Be wary of the Wild Saurians! The Worgens you will probably be able to handle without too much problem, especially if you use the Water spell. Most other fiends in the zone are not aggressive. Look for Mysterious Glint pickups around what looks like cherry trees along the southern central crevice and get three Valeblossom Dews from them. Run back to Nalbina and teleport or walk back to Dalmasca Estersand: South Bank Village.

**Show Off I (cont'd)**: You should be more than strong enough to handle Nekhbet, a rare game cockatrice that may appear in the Sand-swept Naze zone, at this point. If you are passing through for **Covered Up In Flowers/Treasure Hunter Mog** and you see it appear, take it out.

**Covered Up In Flowers/Treasure Hunter Mog (cont'd)**: You can't give the Valeblossom Dew to Dantro's Wife quite yet as the village needs us to head to the north bank via the ferry to see what is wrong. Speak to the boy on the pier to cross the river. Talk to Ruksel, the boy's father. Return across the river and speak to Dantro's Wife. Follow her advice and look at the flower behind the house. Now head back across the river and approach the large cactroid to complete the **Covered Up In Flowers** portion of the quest.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: You'll find a Cartographer's Guild moogle at the North Bank Village after saving them from the cactroids. Purchase the Mosphoran Highwaste map.

**Treasure Hunter Mog (cont'd)**: Return across the river yet again and speak to Dantro's Wife once more to finally deliver the Valeblossom Dew and Great Serpentskin. Head out of the village and return to speak to her yet again. Head behind her house once again and find the moogle that you have helped cure. If you found all of the ingredients that Dantro's Wife needed, you'll get the Barheim Key, a Golden Amulet, and the achievement. If the moogle doesn't appear right away (Dantro's Wife says they should be recovering soon rather than fully healed), go back out of the village and wait a bit before returning.

**Passage of Death** (Steal/Poach): With both the Thief's Cuffs and the Barheim Key, you are prepared to try to get the Deathbringer. The weapon is stolen from the rare game Ithuno in Barheim Passage: Special Op Sector 5. The fiend is similar to the Mimics in that it will appear as a treasure chest. It has a 20% chance of spawning at the end of the zone, nearby the one-time Arc Scale chest and directly next to a 90% spawning chest that may contain an Aero Mote or Glacial Staff.
- From Dalmasca Estersand: South Bank Village, head to the locked door that leads to Barheim Passage, found in the Murmuring Defile zone. Use the Barheim Key to unlock it and you'll be back in Barheim Passage: The Zeviah Subterrane. Proceed to Special Op Sector 5 via Great Central Passage's southwest exit.
- Be aware that the enemies in this zone will greatly exceed your current level and will take you out in one or two hits. Just run!
- Make your way to the end of Special Op Sector 5 and hope that the mimic chest is there. It'll have a purple body with silver sides compared to the normal brown and gray chest color. You'll see it directly behind a bolder on the train tracks.
- There is a high level Suriander (frog enemy) that hangs out directly near the mimic chest.
- Some good preparation can make this go more smoothly:
  - Tank: Set them as the party leader. As your highest defense character, they should be attacking the Ithuno to keep aggro on themselves while your stealer is busy. Add gambits to throw Hi-Potions and Ethers if necessary.
  - Healer: Set up gambits to cast Protect on the whole party. It's not a huge defense boost, but it will keep the party alive a little bit longer to get healing done. Set up Cura casts at a higher HP threshold than normal. I used less than 60% HP to keep the Cura flowing.
  - Stealer: Ensure they have the Thief's Cuffs equipped! Their ONLY gambit should be to steal from whatever foe the party leader is targeting.
- After running in and seeing if Ithuno is even spawned, use the corner away from the tortoise and the Suriander by Ithuno where your healer can prep Protect on everyone and heal up if any damage was taken on the way in. You should draw no aggro in this corner, nor should your party end up targeting any monsters in this spot.
- Attempt to interact with the Ithuno chest to start the stealing process while the Suriander is not looking. If you do draw in the Suriander, run back to the corner and it should pull back, along with the Ithuno.
- Once the Ithuno and ONLY the Ithuno is targeting your tank, the stealing should commence. With Thief's Cuffs, the steal chance is 6% so it may take a while.
- If it is taking long and MP is getting drained (or if you want to be preemptive about it while your Protect is up), try to lure Ithuno toward the zone exit. This is tricky because of the other monsters along the way and Ithuno may try to run back if aggro is not maintained. The tank should be able to continue maintaining attacks while you also pull back and the healer tries to keep everyone alive.
  - The goal of drawing Ithuno to the exit is so that you can zone out, heal and buff up without dealing with taking damage, and then zone back in where Ithuno will be waiting for you to continue stealing from.
- In my own attempts at this, I struggled initially just trying to run in there and steal as I was getting wiped by the Ithuno and Suriander. I came up with the formation and gambits above to try to do a sustained stealing session with the intent that I'd just get the achievement and then reset. Once I set up my party of Basch, Balthier, and Fran with the above and drew the Ithuno into the safe corner, Fran stole the Deathbringer in three attempts! As soon as I heard the achievement, I booked it out of there and got to keep the thing without burning through a ton of resources. I hope others are just as lucky with this as I was but hopefully this strategy helps with making this a bit easier to deal with.

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: With Barheim Passage accessible again, make sure to touch the Teleport Save Crystal in the North-South Junction to activate this teleport spot.

**The Bhujerba Madhu Man** (Side Quest): Completing this little quest that has no impact on the game will enable you to make some money as well as enter all of Bhujerba's zones for the **Cartography** achievement. The goal here is to find all of the bottles of Bhujerban Madhu around the city and give them to people who want them to earn 1000 gil per bottle. I'll list location, where the bottle is found, and who wants to buy it. For the achievement, you do not have to have all of the bottles in your possession first. Feel free to sell them as you find them. You can sell another bottle to the same seller if you leave a zone and reenter to reset their status.
- Aerodrome: Bottle is on suitcases north of the Save Crystal. The buyer is sitting on railing talking to imperials right nearby.
- Armor shop: Bottle is in a partially open cupboard by the store merchant. Sell it to the Shop Clerk standing in front of the counter (right next to the cupboard).
- Weapon shop: Bottle is on crates up the stairs near the entrance, next to a display with hammers. Sell it to a woman near the crossbows on the lower level.
- Magick shop: Bottle is on counters topped with urns and bottles up the stairs near the entrance. Sell it to the Bhujerban Guru just to the left of where the bottle was.
- Travica Way: Bottle is on the ground near the southeast exit of the zone, where a man is crouching while talking to Street Kid. You can sell it to a Bhujerban man leaning against the wall across the street from the magick shop.
- Khus Skygrounds: Bottle is on a crate with a moogle standing on it, north of the street merchant. Sell it to the Bhujerban woman on the west side of the zone somewhat near a seeq.
- Technicks shop: Bottle is on a stack of books near the stairs by the shop counter. Sell it to the moogle Shop Clerk standing on the carpet in the middle of the shop.
- Miners' End: Bottle is on crates just south of the gambit shop entrance. You can sell it to the bangaa labeled as Lhusu Miner just south of the intersection from the gambit shop.
- Gambit shop: Bottle is on a bookshelf right up the stairs near the entrance. Sell it to the seeq Shop Clerk near the opposite stairs.
- Kaff Terrace: Bottle is to the right, just as you step on the bridge, on the railing next to a seeq. Sell it to a Bhujerban woman at the north end near the edge after the bridge railing.
- Lhusu Square: Bottle is near the entrance to the mine, on the rail where water is flowing down the slope. Sell it to the Lhusu Miner hume sitting on a box near the seeq merchant.
- The Staras Residence: Bottle is just right of the entrance, on some boxes behind a large dresser. You can sell it to Niray, but you can't sell it to her until later. Perhaps you can sell it to one of the others who wants to buy bottles.
- Cloudborne Row: Bottle is just south of the Staras Residence on some boxes in the dead end alley. Sell it to the Cloudborne Patron hume standing over a collapsed bangaa.
- The Cloudborne: The final bottle is on a table with two women, one with her head on the table. The achievement unlocks once you pick it up. You can sell it to Magu, a seeq sitting among a bunch of urns in an alcove of the tavern near the entrance.

**Show Off I (cont'd)**: While traversing Giza Plains during the Rains, there is a 20% chance of the Rain Dancer rare game spawning in a few of the zones. I found it in Toam Hills just south of the bridge where a Gigantoad was sleeping.

**Paradise Risen** (Hunts): While you are probably not ready to defeat the Gil Snapper yet, you can certainly prepare to access the location it is in while making your way around Giza Plains by knocking down withered trees. There are six trees in all the Giza Plains zones except for Gizas South Bank and Warrior's Wash. Knocking all of them down lets you reach Tracks of the Beast. I'll be tackling Gil Snapper later. I have knocked down four of the trees, leaving only the ones in Gizas North Bank and Crystal Glade since I didn't go to those zones while hunting the Croakadile.

**A Ring in the Rain** (Hunts): Since the Rains are currently active in Giza Plains, this is a good time to tackle the Croakadile. Find the quest giver in Nomad Village near the cockatrice pen to start the quest. Travel west and south to Starfall Field. Cross the bridge and head east until the Croakadile jumps out of the water and begins to sing...
- It starts off with Shell and Bravery and uses the Angelsong skill as it's first move, giving itself Regen. If you cast Dispel (or use a Dispel Mote), it'll remove all of the buffs and then keep trying to reapply Regen. You could keep it locked in this state for a while.
- Once about halfway down, it increases in strength with Growing Threat but it isn't too terrible with it's increased damage output. Throw Hi-Potions and cast Cura as needed while keeping up with dealing damage.
- Return the Ring of the Toad and you'll get your reward, achievement, and asked to return the ring to its owner later.

**Hunter of Monsters I** (Bestiary?): If you haven't unlocked this achievement before entering Ozmone Plain, you more than likely will then. As with some of these other bestiary type achievements, experiences will vary for when you unlock them.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: You can get maps for Ozmone Plain and Jahara from a Cartographer's Guild moogle near the chocobo stable in Jahara. You still have to enter every zone in these areas, but the maps will make things easier.

**Thief of the Sand Falls/Passage of Death (cont'd)**: Reminder that these must be completed prior to continuing into Jahara as you will meet the Garif War-chief upon trying to cross the bridge.

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: Another Teleport Save Crystal is at the entrance into Jahara. Interact with it to register the location.

**Beast My Guest II/Ward of the Wood** (Challenge): After the events at Jahara, Larsa will join as a guest (average of the two highest character levels + 2 levels). My Larsa joined at level 23, as a point of reference. Now you will want to keep an eye on Larsa's level for these two boss challenge achievements. Don't let him reach level 31!

**The Defense of Ozmone Plain** (Hunts): Speak to the petitioner in Jahara to start the hunt and then head to The Shred. Enkelados shouldn't be too difficult for a party with levels in the low 20s.
- It starts off with Protect and Shell. You can Dispel these if you wish and Enkelados may occasionally reapply these buffs., but not necessarily as aggressively as Croakadile did.
- This mark seems to just use physical attacks, dealing more damage as it's health drops. It also uses a multihit physical skill called Spinkick.
- It can cure itself with the Restore skill up to three times.
- My strategy was to use Larsa's Bubble spell and Decoy from any other caster on my tank to keep Enkelados off of my magic user, who was using the Aero spell. Everyone else was doing physical attacks and curing as needed. I could have used Dispel but it wasn't really necessary. It only healed itself once and tried a second time before I killed it.

**Soul Mate Matchmaker** (Side Quest): A little quest that you can handle at any time after having visited Jahara for the first time. In Rabanastre: Southgate, speak to the viera at the chocobo stables. You'll know you are talking to the right one when the title during her text box says, "Wandering Viera". She walks off toward Southern Plaza. Follow after her and speak with the hume on the north side of the fountain, labeled as "Lovestruck Man". He says that he saw a viera that looks like the one that he fell in love with that went into East End. Follow after her (this is creepy...) and you'll not find her there. She actually went to the gambit shop in North End. After speaking with her, the wandering viera wanders off again, this time to The Sandsea. Speak to her twice more (she's sitting on the railing upstairs). Now run back to Lovestruck Man and agree to be his matchmaker. Return to The Sandsea once more to let her know and then go back to the fountain to get the viera's bow and the achievement. Good job, Cupid!

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: There is a map urn in Golmore Jungle: Paths of Chained Light, the first zone you'll enter. You won't be able to enter all zones in the region just yet, but the map will help you track it later.

**Show Off I (cont'd)**: The rare game Midgardsormr has a 20% chance of appearing anywhere in the zone when entering it. If you wish to take it down now, it may be easier to clear out the enemies in the zone first and then just rezone and pass through quickly to see if it spawned while the enemies are gone. It's probably best to wait for this until later, unless you get lucky and it shows up on your way through, since Larsa will gain levels quickly and approach the level cap before you know it.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: Upon entering Eruyt Village speak to the moogle Lulluce to buy a map of the town. You will be visiting all of the zones while you are here.

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: New village, new Teleport Save Crystal. Touch it and be registered.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: The map urn for The Henne Mines is in the Phase 1 Shaft zone, but you have to press the Gate Switchboard button in Pithead Junction A to open the gate to access it. Be cautious of the Jelly ambush after pressing the switch. You don't want to gain too much XP on Larsa before these two upcoming boss fights! Again, the map will be helpful in ensuring all zones are entered.

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: Another Teleport Save Crystal is placed just before the Tiamat boss fight in the Henne Mines. Make use of it to register the spot as well as save.

**Beast My Guest II** (Challenge): This is the first of two boss fight challenge achievements with a level 30 cap.
- It has the same restrictions as the fight with Belias: Party members must have gambits off (Larsa can still use gambits), always have three party members active (though they can die), party members can ONLY use Potions, and Larsa does everything he can to take down Tiamat.
- Since there is a teleport spot just before the boss, make use of it to max out your stock of Potions and get a handful of Gold Needles as well.
- Once you take the northern exit into the boss' arena, you'll see the primed achievement indicator if you met all of the conditions.
- At the start of the battle, make Larsa the party leader. Keep moving him around so that he can regenerate MP during the course of this long fight.
- Larsa has the Focus augment, increasing his strength by 1.5x when his HP is full. If Tiamat is focused on another character, it may help cut down on the time of the battle to try to top up Larsa's HP so that he does more damage.
- Take advantage of Larsa's Balance spell, especially when combined with Bubble. If Larsa is getting targeted and is at about half HP, use Balance to do a bunch of damage to Tiamat AND force the boss to cast Reflect. This gives you time to get Larsa's health back up. Just be careful to not let Larsa get too low on HP because Tiamat can do combo attacks on occasion and will decimate any character who's HP is too low. Once Reflect wears off, feel free to repeat the above when the opportunity presents itself. It may not be as possible to use this when Tiamat's health gets low though due to Tiamat's script changes.
- Tiamat will use Breath twice during the battle as its HP passes 40% and 20% thresholds. This will most likely inflict Sap on everyone except Larsa because of his Tourmaline Ring. Because of Breath happening twice, it may be prudent to try to keep the initial party members alive until the second Breath. This will ensure that the second group of characters don't get afflicted with the condition.
- Before swapping in your second team of characters, make absolutely certain that they have their gambits turned off before exiting the menu... Don't be like me and have to start over because of this. Turn them off on everyone before the fight! Also, make sure there are always three active party members while swapping. Bring the inactive characters in first before removing the active party.
- Disablega is, without a doubt, the worst part of this challenge. This will be the thing that causes a drain on your Potions the most as you try to keep Larsa alive with anyone who manages to not get afflicted. Hopefully you get lucky and Larsa will not get proc'd but it seemed to happen pretty frequently, lengthening the battle. The AI script states that Tiamat will use it when the opponents it wants to target are far away. However, I was standing right in front of the fiend along with the rest of my party and Tiamat was using it all the time... Maybe that was just bad luck on my part.
- I did notice that Tiamat is, seemingly, lazy in its selection of character to attack. If someone is directly in front of the fiend, it seems to want to attack them more than others. You can use this to your advantage by swapping party leader to someone else with high HP and put them in front of Tiamat as a potentially appetizing snack. This can spread the wealth in HP reduction or focus it on one who may be better at guarding than others.
- At 20% HP remaining, Tiamat's defense will increase as shown by Larsa's attacks doing about 60-75% less damage. Be on your toes for the remainder of the battle. Of course, Balance will still do the full amount of damage, as long as Reflect is off of Tiamat.
- Achievement will unlock on the final hit. That was definitely a test of endurance... Now there's only one of these **Beast My Guest** challenges remaining...

### A Pleasant Lie That ➡️ Differences Between Our Lands Fades

***Level Cap Reminder***: The cap of level 30 still stands with one more boss fight rapidly approaching.

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: The number of teleport spots is getting larger. Interact with the newly accessible one in Golmore Jungle: The Parting Glade.

**Ward of the Wood** (Challenge): And here is the other level capped challenge! For this challenge, on top of being less than level 30, only Fran and Larsa can participate in the fight with none of them dying. Larsa cannot have gambits on (but can use anything available to him). Fran cannot use espers or quickenings. Thankfully, the Save Crystal is nearby so you can prepare and try different things quickly to see how it works.
- Prepare by ensuring Larsa's gambits are off, and putting at least Bubble on Fran and Larsa. If you have Protect available on Fran, that would be good to prepare as well. If you have Aero available on Fran, that would be the spell to have as your primary attack gambit. Aero/Aeroga Motes are a backup to Aero, if you happen to have any. If you have the Sleep spell on Fran, that should be used before your attack gambit, if you have spells available for attacking. Stock up on items to cure status effects like Smelling Salts for removing Confuse, Handkerchief for removing Oil, or if you have Esuna available, you could use that though it may be better to save MP for dealing damage.
- When using spells, keep moving around the arena to keep your MP regenerating as long as you can. While Fran acts automatically with gambits, manually direct Larsa to use items or Shades of Black to support Fran. Keeping your distance, if possible, can also help potentially avoid the Sporefall skill when the Elder Wyrm uses it.
- When Sporefall is used, recover from any status effects as necessary. Oil is particularly important to remove because if Elder Wyrm follows up with Fireball, expect to die.
- Larsa should be focused on healing and perhaps trying to keep Elder Wyrm's focus with attacks or Shades of Black. You'll need to be attentive to Larsa being inactive and issue commands as the battle goes on. This is hard to do in fast forward, unfortunately, but if you can manage keeping Larsa active while in fast forward, by all means do so. With luck, Larsa's Shades of Black uses will produce things like Scathe, Flare, and Aeroga! If Fran is NOT a Red or Black Mage, then Shades of Black will probably be your primary means of dealing damage instead.
- So, if Fran isn't a Red or Black Mage, there are some recommendations on the achievement's comments about what to do. The consensus is to get the Nihopalaoa accessory. This makes items do the inverse of what their intended action is. For example: throwing a potion will hurt the target rather than heal. For the Elder Wyrm, using Alarm Clocks on it will put it to sleep, guaranteed! Fran should then be trying to keep Elder Wyrm asleep while Larsa uses Shades of Black.
  - To get the Nihopalaoa, you'll need to grind for loot to sell that will unlock it in the bazaar. You need to sell three Blood-stained Necklace, two Death's-Head, and three Leo Gem. Note that these all come from higher level enemies and will require stealing to avoid exceeding levels.
    - Blood-stained Necklace: Shambling Corpse (found in Zertinan Caverns: Athroza Quicksands) rare steal or dropped from them if you have the Warmage's Monograph
    - Death's-Head: Dark Skeleton (found in Golmore Jungle: The Rustling Chapel) drop with Warmage's Monograph, rare game Grave Lord's rare steal (found in same place after chaining the Dark Skeletons that appear there)...
    - Leo Gem: Drop/steal from various dragons and dinosaurs. Wild Saurian is probably the most accessible to steal them from.
    - As you can see, this is pretty ridiculous to do while trying to maintain low levels. It may be easier to just fight it out if you have a damage dealing Fran, or a Fran that blocks a lot can take point on tank duties while Larsa casts random black magic. You can grind Aero/Aeroga Motes from chests as well. There are options, but Nihopalaoa seems excessive to get. Of course, it does seem other people have done this so it's certainly possible...
- Once the Elder Wyrm is defeated, we have a new level cap: level 32. It's not much of a difference, but Larsa won't be with us for the next one, so you should actually have more room.

**Show Off I (cont'd)**: With the level cap lifted somewhat, you can try to take out the rare game Phyllo in The Branchway. It has a 20% spawn chance at the dead end on the west side or on the west side of the southern path. It's probably easiest to just rezone and check the western dead end until it shows up. Phyllo is a bat-like Redmaw enemy. Some sources mention that its appearance is based on wiping out the malboros in the area but that is not the case.

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: Welcome to Mt. Bur-Omisace. New city area, new Teleport Save Crystal. Touch it and add this location to your collection.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: Another Cartographer's Guild moogle is here with maps for Mt. Bur-Omisace and Paramina Rift. Stock up and we'll eventually enter the associated zones.

**Show Off I (cont'd)**: In Paramina Rift: Karydine Glacier, the rare game Anchag can spawn near the south center section of the zone if all enemies are defeated. Clear everyone out, including Wild Onions, then zone out and back in to find it wandering alone. It is a Dullahan type fiend.

**Epic of the Forgotten Grimoires** (Bazaar? Items?) Once you have purchased the last of the Forgotten Grimoires in the bazaar, this achievement will unlock. I had the funds while grinding some equipment and levels in Paramina Rift so I purchased my last couple from a Mt. Bur-Omisace merchant. As always, there is no rush on getting these now unless you want to get them off of your bazaar list (like me!).

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: The Stilshrine of Miriam has a Teleport Save Crystal just outside the front door. Use it and it'll be registered!

**Show Off I (cont'd)**: The rare game Negalmuur can be found in the Ward of the Sword-King zone. To get it to spawn, kill the lone Darkmare in the zone standing in front of the stairs leading down to the Sword of Judgment. Leave the zone and wait for 30 minutes in-game while still in the Stilshrine. Yeah... After returning to Ward of the Sword-King, Negalmuur will be waiting for you. If your levels aren't too high, this may be the best time to take it on, but you can always do this fight later as well. Darkmare respawns if you save and reload the game, so the opportunity could be taken later. Negalmuur spawns in Ghasts which can result in gaining a ton of experience if the rare game isn't eliminated quickly so definitely don't do this if you are close to exceeding level 32. If you do plan to fight it, feel free to just fast forward in the room with the Crystalbug/Save Crystal, where no enemies will spawn, or explore the Stilshrine more and come back to the zone later.
- Negalmuur will spawn near the Miriam Guardian and is a Nightwalker type enemy (giant skull with horns and massive claws).

**Show Off I (cont'd)**: There is a secret passage through a fake wall to the west from where the Darkmare was at. Just walk along that wall until it disappears and climb the steps. At the top of all of the stairs is a secret room in the Cold Distance zone which has a bunch of traps as soon as you walk in. Head in with the Float status or take the traps anyway. Hopefully the rare game Matriarch Bomb is in there. If not, you'll need to clear out the Oilings in the room and then rezone and try again. I went in, got hit with Confuse and Berserk from the traps, and Matriarch Bomb was there. My team hit each other, removing the Confuse and then decimated the rare game with physical attacks. Take heed that you will face a TON of Oilings as you descend the stairs and possibly gain a level while taking them on so just run if you are too close to exceeding level 32 or come back for this later.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: You'll naturally go through all of the zones in Stilshrine of Miriam, but you may not fully uncover each zone, especially Walk of Reason if you are just trying to get through without battles. There is a map urn in Ward of Steel in the room with the rotating statue after the boss fight with Vinuskar.

**A Song of Ice and Fire (cont'd)**: Make your way back to where the Sword of Judgment was now that the path is open to reach the Hall of Worth where Mateus is waiting. Prior to entering, you'll want to reduce your party down to only the character that has Belias. If you haven't assigned that esper to a character yet, now is the time! The challenge here, aside from the level cap and not dying, is to not use the attack command with your party member AND defeat Mateus with Belias' Hellfire (the esper's ultimate attack). The irony here is that Mateus and his Ice Azers have resistance to fire attacks.
- With my setup of a Samurai Ashe having Belias, it was trickier than I expected. I ultimately ended up "brute forcing" this challenge. I opened by summoning Belias, taking control of him, and physically attacking the Ice Azers with him. Once all Ice Azers were killed (they need to be or they'll start healing Mateus with Curaga as he gets to half HP), I let Belias control himself as he used Painflare until he would leave with a Hellfire. With my Ashe at level 29, Belias was only doing 575-600 HP with Painflare and a paltry ~950 HP with Hellfire. Once gone, my Ashe was programmed to just heal herself with Cure magic at 50% HP. So I let her get hit by Mateus until her Mist Charge was restored (she only had 2 at this point). Once restored, I brought Belias back to let him fight with Mateus. Ashe would continue to Cure both of us. Once Mateus phase changes at 50% HP, he gets quite aggressive with Blizzaja. Though not too damaging to either Belias or Ashe, it can cause Sap on Ashe. That's still not an issue with her MP stock and constant curing. After Belias knocked down Mateus to less than 20% HP and used Hellfire again, I summoned him one more time, keeping the intensity on healing Belias while he used Painflare. Mateus has no charge time for attacks so he is much quicker and drains Belias' health quite fast. I ended up using an Elixir on him just to make sure he survived long enough to get Mateus' HP down. Once Mateus' HP was within 5%, I manually trigger Hellfire and won. I then reset so that I could do the fight with a full party without consuming my Elixir.
- One strategy mentioned on the achievement's comments was to get an Opal Ring so that my Samurai (or a Black/Red Mage character) could use Shades of Black without fear of spells reflecting back from Mateus. That would have definitely made my life easier if I had be able to acquire one before hand. Another strategy was to use a character with access to Souleater and Belias just heals you as you sacrifice HP to do damage. There is a lot of flexibility though! Just make sure your party member doesn't attack, use Belias as a support or primary attacker while your character supports, and don't die!
- If you have the capability of inflicting Oil, Mateus is susceptible to it. With that status, fire element damage will still be boosted despite Mateus' resistance to it. 300% drops to 150%, but that's better than just the base 50% damage normally caused by fire element damage.
- A strategy used by RA user [Mimicmatter](https://retroachievements.org/user/mimicmatter) was to equip the Tourmaline Ring to reduce ice damage and prevent poison/sap as well as make use of Motes to deal damage. Motes are not affected by the Reflect status so you can use them to deal damage. Mimicmatter mentioned using Balance Motes to get rid of the Ice Azers as well so that they don't cure Mateus.
- ***New Level Cap***: With the defeat of Mateus, the next cap is level 35!

**Welcome to Hell** (Espers?): If you haven't used Belias before this fight, you will definitely get this achievement with the **A Song of Ice and Fire** achievement or during the battle, since you are required to use Hellfire. Once the skill is triggered, this achievement will unlock.

### Differences Between Our Lands Fades ➡️ Consider Your Bones, Old Man!

***Level Cap Reminder***: Level 35 is what needs to be maintained at or below before the next boss. This is a good time to get some more hunts done and optional bosses as well though as you continue to unlock more licenses and gain some more levels.

**The Condemner** (Espers?): In order to access Zeromus in Stilshrine of Miriam, you will need the Stone of the Condemner. After the events that occur after defeating Judge Bergan and confirming the plans to head into Archades, you'll see a nu mou Acolyte walking nearby. Speak to them to receive the Stone of the Condemner. The fight against Zeromus is a ways off yet (unless you intend to cheese it with Seitengrat, perhaps?), but at least you'll have the key you need now.

**Sister's Test (cont'd)**: Return to Rabanastre to speak to Ktjn once more. She'll discuss her warrior sister and how she thinks that maybe she should try to follow in her footsteps. When she asks, "What do you think?", reply with "I think it's a good idea". That will convince her to join a clan. She then says to speak with her again soon. Almost done!

**Hold All the Cards (cont'd)**: With the amount of money I gained from my travels, I decided to finish up buying the remainder of the gambits at this point.

**Lost in the Pudding** (Hunts): The White Mousse is found in Garamsythe Waterway: West Sluice Control. Head there to fight it and clear out the monsters in the vicinity before heading into the water.
- Before the fight, consider putting Shell on the party or wearing armor that provides protection from the water element. Have one or two characters prepared to cast Fira spells. If you have a main tank character, consider Decoy to keep White Mousse focused on them with physicals. Regen, if available, can also be useful to negate the effects of Poison.
- Doing this after Mt. Bur-Omisace shouldn't be too much trouble though. If you try to do it earlier, it may be tougher, but still doable.
- Return to Sorbet in Westgate to complete the hunt and get your reward and achievement. You'll also get the Sluice Gate Key for further adventuring in the Garamsythe Waterway.

**For Whom the Wyrm Tolls** (Hunts): Head to Dalmasca Westersand: Windtrace Dunes. If there is a sandstorm, the Ring Wyrm will appear around the south center of the map. Rezone until you have a sandstorm.
- Fire is its weakness but also what it uses. If you have Ruby Rings, these will reflect the damage back, making this fight fairly simple. Also, start off with Dispel to remove its buffs.
- Ring Wyrm can inflict Disable, Immobilize, and Sap. If you have Remedy Lore 1, this will help counter that. Thankfully, you can now purchase the Remedy item in shops so feel free to use them.
- Belias can shine here as well, since fire element heals him and he uses fire attacks also.
- Return to Balzac in Lowtown: North Sprawl to get the reward and achievement.

**Calm the Sandstorm** (Side Quest): Get the Wind Globe from one of the two Dynast Cactus (large round cactus with a yellow flower on the top) in the isolated portion of Dalmasca Westersand: Windtrace Dunes. Head back to Rabanastre: Westgate and talk with Rimzat to get the Windvane. Head back to Dalmasca Westersand and enter the Wyrm's Nest zone to do battle with the Earth Tyrant.
- The Earth Tyrant is a physical attacker. You can't go wrong with using Protect and Regen on your team. Decoy can be useful as well to ensure your tank is getting targeted while the spell casters or main attackers aren't. Wind is the weak element, so use Aero.
- When the boss' HP gets low, it's physical defense will rise greatly. Keep the pressure up on maintaining your spell caster alive as Aero is still as effective. Have the tank support healing if necessary. Earth Tyrant will also attack more frequently and combo so be careful.
- Upon defeat, the achievement will unlock. Congrats! You have another way to get to Dalmasca Estersand: The Yoma and North Bank Village!

**Tingling Toast** (Hunts): Marilith can be found in Zertinan Caverns: Invitation to Heresy (the first zone when entering from Dalmasca Westersand). Clear out the zone of enemies and wait for five minutes in a dead end where the sun is shining and two Speartongue toads were hanging out.
- Marilith is FAST! It uses physical attacks and will get more rapid when its health is very low. Your cure methods will probably not be able to keep up if you are doing this fight at this point in the game (I was level 29 at the time). So, save your quickenings for this point where Marilith is too quick and your attacks aren't landing. That'll finish the job.
- It pays to be defensive again. Protect and Regen will be of use to get Marilith to the low HP threshold where it speeds up. You can also afflict it with Slow and Blind, though that will only help so much near the end of the fight. It also has buffs at the start so Dispel them.
- Return the Serpentwyne Must to The Sandsea's Tavernmaster to complete the hunt and get the achievement.

**Crime and Punishment** (Hunts): Before the fight with Ultros, I mean Orthros, in Garamsythe Waterway: Southern Sluiceway, it may be a good idea to head to the Save Crystal in West Sluice Control so that you can retry quickly if you have problems. Also, you can grab the Garamsythe Candle from an urn near the Save Crystal too.
- For the fight to start, you must be a party of Fran, Ashe, and Penelo (if you are familiar with Orthros from Final Fantasy VI and other games, he really hates muscle men). Once started, feel free to swap back to your ideal party.
- As with the other previous hunts, Protect and Regen can be very helpful. Shell is a good addition this time since Ult... Orthros can cast Darkra. Expect tons of negative status effects as well. Consider a Remedy Lore character with a Remedy gambit. Since this iteration of Orthros is a flan, the fire element is effective. As typical with these marks, HP critical will result in increased attacks, defense, and attack power. Switch to quickenings and Belias as appropriate.
- Return to the Contrite Thief in Lowtown to get the reward and the achievement. You'll also receive the Blackened Fragment, which is a part needed for eventually getting Chaos and a few achievements down the road.

**Shrouded in Mist** (Characters?): This is definitely flexible for when it unlocks for players since it is dependent on the jobs picked, if a player wants to or is willing to wait for more advantageous quickening positions on the license board, or if a player just wants to unlock them all right away. I finally unlocked my last quickening and this achievement when I got to Ashe's Samurai license board spot that provides access to the +435 HP license, requiring unlocking a bunch of high LP accessory spots.

**Paradise Risen** (Hunts): The weather now cycles in Giza Plains so if it is Dry, you'll have to wait for the Rains again before taking on the Gil Snapper. The cycle is 2 hours Dry, 1 hour Rains, using the in-game clock. Thankfully, once you have knocked down the six withered trees once, you won't have to repeat it if the weather cycles. If you are unsure of where you are at in the cycle, there is a seeq Adventurer you can talk to in Southgate who will become "Weather Eye" and give you a very general idea of how long until the next weather change (they'll say "The Rains can't be far off, now" when it is close, like 5-10 minutes). Do note that the weather will NOT change while you are in Giza Plains. If the time elapsed for a weather change, it won't occur until you leave the region.
- Once you are in the Rains season and can cross the "bridge" into the Tracks of the Beast zone, Bansat the seeq will tell you if the weather is appropriate for Gil Snapper to appear. The mark will only show during a thunderstorm. Rezone until the weather is appropriate.
- One thing to consider is if the weather is initially not right, use this time to clear the zone of the Silicon Tortoises so that they aren't an issue while fighting the Gil Snapper.
- Once in the proper weather, prepare! Setup the usual Protect, Shell, Regen, at least on your tank. Also, Slow is effective in this fight. Dispel should be used at the start of the fight to remove the initial buffs. Thundara will be a primary source of damage.
- As always, the fight will get tougher as its health drops. Be prepared for more aggressive attacks and less damage dealt to it.
- After you win, make sure to get the Feather of the Flock item from the urn in the southeast. Return to Crystal Glade and read the Soggy Letter to learn that you can't finish the hunt until the Dry season. Speak with Nanau in the Nomad Village once it is Dry again and get your reward and achievement.

**The Dead Ought Sleep Forever** (Hunts): Return to Henne Mines' front entrance with a chocobo and head through the blue gate exit to Phase 1 Shaft to find Ixtab.
- Compared to Gil Snapper, this mark will be easier at these levels.
- The mark will spawn near where the map urn was, at the crossroads.
- Ixtab is susceptible to Berserk which will make it not be able to use any of its spells and skills that cause status effects. Blind can also be used to avoid contact damage. Stop and Slow also work though they are limited in time. If you can't use these, then be ready with Remedy or other restorative items.
- This mark also likes to use Doom so if the fight draws on long enough, you may need to revive party members.
- Continue on after defeating it to find the Mindflayer in Phase 1 Dig, or return to Jahara to report success and get your rewards and achievement.

**The Mine Flayer** (Hunts): Return to Henne Mines' front entrance with a chocobo and go to Phase 1 Dig (or head there after fighting Ixtab, if you wish). It spawns in the south of the zone and only if the party has full MP.
- The Mindflayer is tougher than Ixtab was but is also susceptible to Berserk, Blind, and Slow.
- The mark's favorite move is Invert, which swaps HP and MP values. Be ready to heal up (or have gambits ready) if that happens. It can cause Blind and Sap status and even raise its own level. With a high magick resistance, it's best to have physical attackers.
- At 20% HP, the Mindflayer can fully heal itself with Soul Etude. You can avoid this completely by using your quickenings near that point. I used my mist moves at around 30-40% HP on its life bar, killing it before it could heal itself.
- Return to Jahara to report the successful hunt and get the achievement and rewards. Completing this hunt will eventually let you go to face Zodiark, once you have at least 10 espers under your control though.

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: Reach Mosphoran Highwaste while enroute to Archades. The zone Babbling Vale has a Teleport Save Crystal.

**Trouble in the Hills** (Hunts): Atomos waits for you in Mosphoran Highwaste: Northern Skirts. Clear out the Vultures surrounding the mark so that they don't join in.
- This fiend has a high magick resistance, so stick with physical attacks. It starts with Protect, Shell, and Haste so Dispel those right away. It can be hit with Slow status but it will remove it and other status effects with Purify and then follow up with White Wind to make itself immune to all status effects.
- Prepare with Protect and Regen and then beat Atomos up. It's physical defense is not that great so it shouldn't take too long to beat at low level 30s. If its HP gets low and starts to try to heal itself, consider quickenings to wrap it up before that happens.
- When you can, return to Nalbina to see Burrogh and turn in the completion for the reward and achievement.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: In The Salikawood: Trunkwall Road is a map urn. You won't need or want to access all of the zones here for now, but the map will help later on.

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: Once you start exploring The Salikawood properly as part of the Moogle Boss quest to find their workers, you'll find a Teleport Save Crystal in Quietened Trace, right near where the King Bomb boss fight is.

**Blow Up the Jungle** (Side Quest): Enter Grand Bower to face off against King Bomb. This boss is optional, blocking the way to the rest of The Salikawood as well as one of the entrances to the Necrohol of Nabudis. Given that we need to get over to this other side of The Salikawood to fight marks as well as get the Ensanguined Shield before going to Sochen Cave Palace, we will definitely need to fight this boss now.
- Prepare by putting on Protect, Shell, and Regen. Set up a gambit specifically for removing Oil with Handkerchiefs. Spell casters should use the Water spell.
- King Bomb starts off with Haste and spawning a couple of Bombs. Dispel the Haste effect right away and completely ignore the Bombs. Healing should be able to keep up with the damage they deal because of the buffs prior to the fight.
- Completely focus everything on King Bomb. The boss will use Renew to fully restore its health and will do so at least once through the fight at our lower levels. If you keep the pressure up on King Bomb, getting the fiend down to around 30-40% of its health and you see it starting to Renew, use quickenings to finish the job.
- You now have access to the back side of the region and the Necrohol as well.

**Rodeo to the Death** (Hunts): You'll find Braegh, the lightning horse, in the Corridor of Ages zone, near the entrance to Necrohol of Nabudis. Set up the usual buffs and be ready to heal quickly with Hi-Potions because Braegh can use Invert, like the Mindflayer. It is weak to the ice element so Blizzara will do a lot of damage as well as physical attacks. Once defeated, return to Va'Kansa in Mosphoran Highwaste - Babbling Vale to complete the hunt and get the achievement.

**Hunter of Monsters II** (Bestiary?): While making my run through Necrohol of Nabudis to find the Ensanguined Shield, I unlocked this achievement as I was targeted by various enemies. Fun! Hopefully I don't die so I can not worry about losing the registration of these enemies (or just end up coming back here later anyway for Chaos and treasures).

**Where is the Zodiac Spear?** (Treasure?): Upon entering the Cloister of the Highborn zone, a primed achievement marker will appear to identify that you are in the correct location. Being here at this level is obviously quite dangerous and enemies will take chunks out of you quickly. Using Protect, Shell, and Regen could help keep you alive while pacing back and forth between the zone entrance and the treasure chest location. Additionally, if the previous zone doesn't have enemies crowded around the entrance, that could be a spot to run to for healing back up and buffing.
- The chest itself has a 3% spawn chance, appearing in a small room located at the northern most point of this zone and going south to enter the room. Expect to pace back and forth a lot.
- A possible strategy is to use the Seitengrat to eliminate the enemies on the route. You'll gain a lot of experience points though, so only do this if you have some buffer before exceeding level 35. This strategy worked really well for me, allowing me to run up and down the path between the zone exit and the chest freely. I only gained one level (32 to 33) from clearing out the enemies along that path.
- There are some really nice spells here if you want to pick them up now. However, if you gain too much experience, it may be better to just reset back to the previous save and not keep the spells. We'll be back here later anyway... I personally decided to not revert back to my save because I wanted to keep the spells and I only gained one level.

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: When you arrive at the Hunter's Camp in Phon Coast, examine the Teleport Save Crystal after the cutscene.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: The Phon Coast is a very large region. Getting the map from the Cartographer's Guild moogle will make getting this achievement much easier. The moogle is located in the north between the two northern exits of the Hunter's Camp.

**Mandragoran Royalty** (Side Quest?) This is required in order to progress with the game, but it is a distraction along the way just the same. In Tchita Uplands: The Nameless Spring is an Archadian Wayfarer. Speak to him to learn about his missing son and the terrible beasts that need to be destroyed. This person gives you the Soul Ward Key if you accept, which is required to progress in Sochen Cave Palace.

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: If you head out the northwest exit of The Highlands, you'll come across the missing child in The Chosen Path zone! The son and parent are just in the wrong locations! Also there is a Teleport Save Crystal here to register.

**Mandragoran Royalty (cont'd)**: Proceed north through Sochen Cave Palace: Doubt Abandoned and open the locked door with the Soul Ward Key. As you enter, the boss fight begins with five Mandragoras. They'll probably all run off initially, seemingly trying to separate the group as some of your party attacks and others prepare spells.
- Use Escape to pull the party together and have the Mandragoras come towards you. Once grouped together, unleash your spells.
- They all start with Haste. Dispel it.
- Each Mandragora is a different type, each with different elemental weaknesses. Thankfully, none of them have any resistances. You could use different spells for each one, or just blast them all with Fira. It shouldn't take too long.
- If you are feeling cheeky, you could wait until they are grouped together and use quickening combos. The follow up concurrence should destroy all of them in one shot if you chained enough together.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: The Sochen Cave Palace map urn is located in the eastern side of Mirror of the Soul, in a small alley near the northeast exit.

**Who You Gonna Call** (Challenge): Grind to get Dark Energy from the bazaar (sell 1 Bat Wing, 3 Grimoire Aidhed, and 3 Grimoire Togail)?? The really seems like a good cheese way to handle this fight if you have chosen a disadvantageous job. There has also been discussion in the achievement's comments about grinding up the damage for a Dark Matter to one-shot Ahriman but that seems excessive compared to the Dark Energy grind. Another option discussed (and possible with my black mage Penelo) is the use of Reflectga Motes to keep Doom from landing and using the Aeroga spell to do damage. So where do I farm Reflectga Motes from? They can only be purchased at the clan provisioner when at max clan rank so perhaps an enemy can drop them or chests may have them? I think I have the Ruby Ring accessory as well (obtained from Stilshrine of Miriam) so I could use that? The only problem with this is potentially getting confused... Unless that is caused by a spell. It looks like Confuse is caused by a skill so it probably isn't reflected. Reflect doesn't prevent Doom from landing... what the fuck was that one person talking about... ugh.
- If you have a job that has access to Remedy Lore 3, this challenge isn't an issue since you can cure Doom status with the item.
- Ahriman is susceptible to only the Slow status, which can be useful to have on them to reduce the chances for it to deal damage and cast Doom on Penelo. This can be done with the Sakura-saezuri ninja sword (found in a chest in this dungeon), with the time magick spell, or with a Nihopalaoa (discussed how to get this in **Ward of the Wood**) equipped and using a Remedy on the boss.
- To prevent getting confused, the Bowline Sash accessory is useful. It also boosts the magick power stat as a bonus for a red or black mage Penelo. If you have Nihopalaoa, you'll need to swap these accessories around to prevent getting confused while also trying to keep Ahriman slowed. Using Ruby Ring to have Reflect up would obviously prevent the use of Bowline Sash for confuse prevention.
- With a white mage Penelo, Ahriman can be hit with Curaga to deal damage as well.
- Immobilize can be used which can cause issues if Doom is already cast, but it shouldn't be a deal breaker as Ahriman will eventually come to you with it's clones within about 1 tick of Doom.
- Okay!!! I managed it with black mage Penelo at level 35! I had two Hastega Motes to keep my speed up through the fight. I buffed Penelo at the door before the fight with Protect, Shell, Regen, Bubble (using a Bubble Mote I had), Faith, and Reflect. I had a gambit set up to cast Aeroga on the foe with the highest HP. I didn't have a Cloud Staff so I equipped the Judicer's Staff since that was my strongest magick power weapon. I equipped the Bowline Sash to prevent confusion as well. Upon entering the boss chamber, I immediately used a Hastega Mote since Ahriman will always teleport initial to dodge any initial spells. I then let Penelo cast Aeroga, landing about 4k of damage per attack while Faith is applied. This pushed Ahriman quickly down in health to avoid early Doom casts. My typical experience with this setup was to see Doom come out at around half of Ahriman's HP remaining and with my Shell gone at this point it would usually land on Penelo. At this point, I used my Scathe Mote to knock out around 4k-6k of damage and then Ahriman will run off to divide. Once Ahriman returns with it's gang, I let Penelo get another Aeroga off to take out some of the riffraff and then started using Shock Motes, noting which Ahriman was being targeted by the gambit so I hit the right one. As long as clones are around, Ahriman won't use Maser Eye. If you do see Maser Eye, you need to throw an X-Potion or Elixir immediately to ensure Penelo's health is at or near max HP. With a bit of luck, and persistence with healing, attack items, and Hastega, I was able to defeat Ahriman with 2 ticks of Doom remaining.
- ***New Level Cap***: A sigh of relief as the next cap is level 50! Since the next challenge requires Reddas to be below level 50, the actual cap for the main party when Reddas joins is no higher than 48.

**Show Off I (cont'd)**: The next zone after the Ahriman fight, Temptation Eluded, has a potential for a rare game. If the zone has Wendigo and Pit Fiend enemies, then defeating all of them will spawn Cubus. There is a 25% chance of the zone containing these enemies over the normal Strikers and Imps. You can easily move two zones away and return via Ahriman's chamber to change the enemies if you want this rare game to show up. You'll know that Wendigos are in the zone if you see a ball of ice where a head should be. Cubus itself is a flan type enemy and will spawn where ever you are when you defeat the final fiend in the zone.

**Record Breaker** (Sky Pirate's Den): Earn over 500,000 clan points to unlock the Reks statue and this achievement. It will unlock without having to look in the Sky Pirate's Den.

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: Upon taking the lift at the end of Sochen Cave Palace, there'll be a Teleport Save Crystal behind you to your right. Interact with it to register the location for future teleporting.

**Chocobo Past (cont'd)**: You'll wrap up this quest and achievement while in Archades. Go to the magick shop and you'll find July up the stairs crouched and listening to more people. Talk to her to receive your reward for helping her in Nalbina.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: The Archades Cartographer's Guild moogle can be found in the technick shop up the stairs. Get the Tchita Uplands and Archades maps on sale to make unlocking this easier.

**A Most Promising Ardent** (Side Quest): In order to get a sandalwood chop, you must get all 28 pinewood chops possible in the four areas of Archades before taking the cab to meet up with Balthier. While you only need 9 pinewood chops to proceed, you will need all 28 to get the sandalwood chop for this achievement AND the Cartographer achievement. The sandalwood chop is required to access one optional location in Archades. To get pinewood chops, you will need to talk to a person in a zone who will give you a phrase to memorize. You then need to find the person that phrase will help so that they give you their pinewood chop.
- I'm not going to list out all of the pairs of people to talk to here as other guides have that covered already, to include the [GameFAQs guide by BobertWABC](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps4/191202-final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age/faqs/78871/walkthrough-part-4-infiltrating-the-empire) so use those to help you find everyone.
- Once you have all the pinewood chops, speak to a chopmaster in one of the shops to convert the pinewood to sandalwood.
- You *could* purchase pinewood chops one at a time to get the 28 you need, but that'll cost you a total of 560,000 gil... It's best to just talk to everyone to get the quest done.

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: After taking the cab to Tsenoble and meeting back up with Balthier, there is a Teleport Save Crystal to the left. Interact with it to register this location.

**Jack-of-All-Trades** (Sky Pirate's Den): You can get the Gil Toss technick on the 70th floor of Draklor Labs, just before the fight with Dr. Cid. Instead of running up the stairs after the cutscene with Reddas, go down the hall to the right past the save crystal to a room that contains the chest with it. I only bring it up here because Draklor is a one time visit dungeon but Gil Toss can still be obtained later on in The Pharos at Ridorana.

**Consider Your Bones, Old Man!** (Progression): There isn't much to defeating Dr. Cid since there is no associated boss challenge here. Beat him and this achievement is yours.

### Consider Your Bones, Old Man! ➡️ Attain to Your Birth Right!

***Level Cap Reminder***: Level 50 is our current level cap. Keep in mind that Reddas will join the party at two levels higher than the average level and is the limiting factor for the fight with Pandaemonium.

**Gone Fishing** (Side Quest): After the events with Dr. Cid, you'll be in Balfonheim. Close by the entrance to the Chivany Breakwater zone, you'll find a fisherman labeled as "Fishing Enthusiast". Talk to him twice to ask about his fishing rod. Head toward the Aerodrome at the opposite end of the zone but don't go in. Return and you'll find the fishing rod left behind. Take it, the Muramata, and the fishing side quest can begin!

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: Near the Teleport Save Crystal that is close to the exit of Balfonheim is a Cartographer's Guild moogle selling maps for Cerobi Steppe and Balfonheim Port to aid in getting this achievement.

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: Examine the Teleport Save Crystal described above to register it.

**Sister's Path (cont'd)**: Now that you have completed Draklor Labs and answered Ktjn's questions appropriately, return to Rabanastre and talk to her on the steps near the north exit of Muthru Bazaar once more. She says that she has made her decision and will reward you if you find her once more. Head to the Clan Hall. You'll find Ktjn sparing with a bangaa in the center of the zone. Talk to her to get the Runeblade and the achievement.

**The Sky Sisters (cont'd)**: With Balfonheim's Aerodrome unlocked, you can now fly and meet all six of Ann's sisters to show them the letter. A new sister will appear on each unique flight from a source to a destination. You'll know if you are seeing a new sister if there is a man talking to the sister at the desk. If you don't see a man there, you have done this flight once before and shown the letter already. This can potentially become difficult to remember if you don't keep track of the flights. Here are all of the unique flights:
- Between Nalbina and Rabanastre in either direction
- Rabanastre and Bhujerba
- Bhujerba and Balfonheim
- Balfonheim and Archades
- Archades and Nalbina
- Rabanastre and Archades
- Balfonheim and Nalbina

Talking to the final sister rewards the Ring of Renewal and the achievement.

**Great Cockatrice Roundup** (Side Quest): You can now start this side quest, provided that you obtained the Feather of the Flock in the area that the Gil Snapper was found. Speak to Terra in the now empty cockatrice pen in the Nomad Village in Dry Giza Plains to kick off this event. There are six to find in total and this quest will take you previous locations to complete additional side quests and minigames to get the cockatrices to return to Giza.

**Dewdrop Jewelers** (Side Quest): As part of the Great Cockatrice Escape side quest, you'll find one of them in Eruyt Village speaking with Mjrn. After talking to the cockatrice named Chit, you'll find red sparkles called Dewdrop Pebbles. Gather them up and give them over to Mjrn. There will be eight around the village. After giving them to Mjrn, speak with Chit once more to get the last Dewdrop Pebble, then give that to Mjrn to complete the quest and send the first cockatrice back home.

**Great Cockatrice Roundup (cont'd)**: Another cockatrice is found in Jahara with a large group of garif near it in the Lull of the Land zone. Talk to the Garif Herder and the cockatrice to start the event. Tell the Garif Herder that the cockatrice is from Giza Plains and you'll be told to speak with the Great-chief. After getting a gift from the Great-chief, hand it over to the cockatrice then speak with the herder once more to end this portion of the quest.

**Great Cockatrice Roundup (cont'd)**: If you teleport to Dalmasca Estersand, you'll find a cockatrice right nearby in South Bank Village. Speak with the cockatrice to learn about their problem. Now you get to play a simplified version of the wolf/goat river crossing puzzle. Speak with the ferry operator, Tchigri, and take the wolf Nathyl along on the trip to North Bank. Cross back with no one. Do another crossing to North Bank, taking Arryl across. Return to South Bank once more with no one, then cross one more time with the cockatrice, Sassan. Follow after Sassan and speak with them to finish this portion of the quest.

**Great Cockatrice Roundup (cont'd)**: Back in Rabanastre's North End zone, a cockatrice is hiding in the northern most area. Talk to it and it will run off. If you haven't completed Dewdrop Jewelers so that Chit returns to Giza Plains, you won't be able to finish this portion of the quest. To catch this cockatrice, Renn, you need to hide among the pillars around the clan hall or the gambit shop. If Renn sees your coming from the front or the rear, they'll take off quickly and you can't catch up. So, come out from the pillars at Renn's side and use a WALKING pace. If you run out, Renn will bolt off. When you walk out from the side, Renn will still maintain their pace and then you can talk to them. Tell Renn that you are not ruffling their feathers. Meet back up with Renn near where this all started and tell them that Chit has returned to complete this portion of the quest.

**Great Cockatrice Roundup (cont'd)**: Make your way to Archades, either via Aerodrome or Teleport. If you haven't spoken to a cockatrice in Old Archades, head down there first and speak to that cockatrice in the Alley of Low Whispers zone. Head back up to Tsenoble in Archades proper and, with your sandalwood chop, take an elevator up to a new zone, the Grand Arcade. Right away you will see a large cockatrice surrounded by three imperial guards. The cockatrice will try to run from you but is much easier to catch than Renn. Just run around the center column and tap circle as you get close to catch them. Tell the cockatrice about the one in Old Archades and you'll complete this portion of the quest.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: There is one more area besides Grand Arcade that is now accessible after Draklor Labs and obtaining a sandalwood chop. Head toward the northeast exit to Highgardern Terrace to have this zone registered for this achievement.

**Great Cockatrice Roundup (cont'd)**: Head to Balfonheim via the Aerodrome or Teleport. At the chocobo stable near the entrance, a cockatrice will be in the pen with the chocobos. Talk to the Chocobo Wrangler and let her see the Feather of the Flock. A Miffed Moogle will stroll up. Talk to them and then to Gurdy to end this portion of the quest.

**Great Cockatrice Roundup (cont'd)**: Once all of the cockatrices have been handled, the achievement will unlock. There is still a reward at Giza Plains Nomad Village to obtain. If it is Dry Season you can get the reward of two Hi-Ethers, but the achievement is already earned.

**Show Off I (cont'd)**: The Wary Wolf has a low chance of spawning in Mosphoran Highwaste - Summit Path instead of a Worgen. It spawned for me while entering the area from the western exit of Southern Skirts. It might be a pain to coax this rare game to appear without some luck. If you do happen to run across it (it looks like the wolves from Dalmasca Estersand but larger than the Worgen), take it out.

**Knight's Honor** (Characters?) Not sure how to categorize these particular achievements. Using the Attack command 10,000 times will unlock this achievement and will certainly be unlocked over the course of working on this set. I got it after Draklor Labs while doing some cleanup of hunts and side quests. Mileage will vary for others on when this unlocks.

**Show Off I (cont'd)**: In The Salikawood - Sun-dappled Path, eliminating the Wyldhares here will cause Spee to spawn in the southwest corner of the zone. Spee can cause confusion and absorbs Fire element.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: While working on some side quest stuff after Draklor, I went into Nabreus Deadlands to work on the Medallions quest. While there, I grabbed the area map from an urn in the Vale of Lingering Sorrow zone. I won't enter every zone quite yet, but I was strong enough to deal with the monsters here to grab it now.

**Shelled Obstruction** (Hunts): Darksteel, a tortoise type mark, can be found in Sochen Cave Palace - Temptation Eluded. It is susceptible to Blind, Poison, Slow, and other status ailments. Blind is most beneficial since it relies primarily on physicals though it may pivot to Dark element magicks as it hits 20% HP. I had my white mage cast Bravery and Faith on the physical and magic attackers (especially since most elemental damage is resisted). I also put Berserk on my physical attacker with a Bacchus Wine to increase their damage output dramatically. Not too terrible of a fight overall. Return to the Homesick Man in Archades - Vint's Armaments to get the reward.

**The Things We Do...** (Hunts): Overlord is one of the headless humanoid enemies and can be found in the entry area of Sochen Cave Palace, Doubt Abandoned. The mark is a very strong physical attacker, likely to be buffed with Bravery at the start of the fight. Overlord is susceptible to Blind and Slow, which may be good debuffs to put on it. It has a skill called Pyromania that hits all that surround the mark for a ton of damage and will likely kill the seeq who is helping you. Buff yourself with Protect and Shell at the start. Once the mark's health gets around halfway down, it will take less damage and become more aggressive. As you get it down near 20% health, consider using your quickenings at this point or Overlord's Pyromania may wipe you out. Return to the seeq in Archades - Bulward's Technicks to get your reward.

**Old Legends, Decaying Bonds** (Hunts): The Lindwyrm only appears in Tchita Uplands - Garden of Life's Circle if the weather is cloudy. If it isn't cloudy or rainy when you first enter Tchita Uplands, leave the area and reenter to change it until then. Also, make sure your party consists of characters with odd levels. Lindwyrm uses Level 2 Sleep and Level 4 Break so being odd leveled will help remove that threat. Once you enter Garden of Life's Circle, the Lindwyrm will be the only monster in the zone. Prep buffs (Protect is probably all you need if you use Silence, but Regen couldn't hurt as well). Once you start the fight, Dispel any buffs on the mark, then start putting Silence and Blind debuffs on it. As the fight progresses, Lindwyrm will use Restore followed by Greater Barrier twice. Make sure to pay attention to the number of times it uses it. Once it has Restore/Greater Barrier the second time, it'll become more defensive and aggressive at 20% HP, like other marks. This is the moment to use quickenings. Return to Fermon in Old Archades - Alley of Muted Signs for the reward.

**Paramina Run** (Hunts): Trickster can be found in Paramina Rift - Frozen Brook. When you first enter the zone, Monid, a bangaa from the clan, will report if Trickster is in the zone or not. If not, use the opportunity to clear out the zone of fiends before trying to get Trickster to spawn. This includes the Ice Elemental that can appear here. Trickster will be much easier to handle if you aren't also dealing with the fodder in the area or the Ice Elemental's magic attacks and debuffs. Once the zone is clear of monsters, use the save crystal in Path of the Firstfall to restore MP as well as prepare for the fight. Set up gambits to provide buffs on the team throughout the fight. Have gambits for Dispel as well as applying Blind and/or Silence. Start off with physical attacks to get it's health down while also staying in one spot as Trickster runs around. No need to chase it as it will return to you. Once Trickster reaches 20% HP, it will put up White Wind to prevent status effects and a paling to make it immune to physical attacks. Additionally, any magic element will heal it except for one at this time. If you hit it with the correct element, it will shift its weakness. Choco-comet can be brutal as well but having healing gambits should be adequate. I made use of Decoy to direct physical attacks on Monid during this invulnerable phase and once the paling wore off, I killed Trickster fairly quickly after that. My party was at level 37 for this fight and it wasn't too much of a struggle. Return to Gurdy in Mt. Bur-Omisace for the reward.

**A Morbid Urn** (Items?): After getting your reward for the Trickster hunt, sell the Deimos Clay, as well as Phobos Glaze (from Gil Snapper) and Horakhty's Flame (from Orthros) if you haven't already. This unlocks the Morbid Urn in the bazaar. When you purchase it for 250,000 gil, you'll get the Canopic Urn and this achievement. This is ideal to get as soon as you can because enemies will now potentially drop the valuable Arcana loot.

**Collector** (Sky Pirate's Den): I unlocked this at the same time that I bought the Canopic Urn in the bazaar, since that is the trigger for the Mimic statue to appear there. The achievement states that you have to check the Den itself for the memory to update but it unlocked immediately upon buying the item so maybe they fixed something that doesn't require the player to check the Sky Pirate's Den first?

**Spendthrift** (Sky Pirate's Den): Purchasing the Canopic Jar also pushed me over the 1 million gil spent requirement to unlock Gurdy's statue in the Sky Pirate's Den. As with other milestone achievements, mileage will vary on when this will unlock but it seems that the typical experience is that it happens around the time that people buy the Canopic Jar if they have been spending money to buy equipment. This will certainly unlock over the course of casual play without any sort of grind to make it happen.

**Antlion Infestation** (Hunts): Once you reach Lhusu Mines - Site 9, you'll start to see Killer Mantis enemies. Libra will tell you that they are weak to wind, which gives you a hint on how to proceed with the upcoming battle. After working your way near the far west side of the zone, buff up your team. Set up gambits on a black mage to use Aeroga and ensure they have Faith on them. A good idea maybe to even have the black mage target the lowest HP enemies with Aeroga. This is because Antlion will consume the Killer Mantises with the Cannibalize skill, which increases its health and level. So focus on taking out the Killer Mantises first! If the first wave of Aeroga doesn't remove the fodder, a follow up with Quickening can help to eliminate them all afterword. After cleaning out Site 9 of its treasures, such as the Expose technick near where the Antlion was, return to Bhujerba - The Staras Residence for the reward. As for where the Site 11 key went... You'll find that at Phon Coast - Hunters' Camp.

**Get My Stuff Back** (Hunts): Upon entering Cerobi Steppe - Northsward, the viera wayfarer who wanted you to do this hunt joins you. No enemies will be in the area other than the mark in the northeast section of the zone. If you have Silence and Blind available, these can be helpful. Vyraal likes to use Immobilize and then run off to heal. If you don't have Silence, equip some Black Belts to ensure at least one character can chase the mark. Slow is also useful, but not as necessary. Keep it up until around 10% HP, when it will put up a barrier that makes it immune to magic. A fairly simple fight with a good physical offense and healing/buff gambits. Quickenings may not even be necessary. For some reason, the viera tell you to meet her at the bar in Balfonheim rather than reward you upon victory, so go back to claim your reward.

**The Deserter's Revenge** (Hunts): Within the hidden areas of Barheim Passage is the West Annex, a place full of Dead Bones and Specters that love to spawn numerously. Bloodwing appears here along the southern most path, potentially with some of the undead enemies here. Bloodwing itself isn't much of a threat as it uses the typical bat enemy attacks. Blind does work and is a good approach to reduce incoming damage while also dealing with potential mobs of skeletons and ghosts. Return to South Bank Village when you are able for the reward.

**The Death Seraph** (Espers): Shortly after Bloodwing is the esper Zalera. This is an interesting fight as there will be a timer near the minimap counting down from five minutes. Fail to defeat the esper before the timer runs out and it is game over! A strategy I used was to have a party of three with two who could cast Curaja and a physical attacker. The physical attacker had the Ruby Ring on in order to have the Reflect status. The Curaja casters had gambits to cast the spell on an ally with Reflect status. This causes the spell to bounce back toward Zalera and the Dead Bones that appear with the esper, damaging them. Zalera is impervious to damage until all the Dead Bones are gone, OR if healing magic is reflected back! This makes taking out the esper fairly simple. One other gambit to use is Phoenix Downs on any ally. Since the esper is going to kill your characters with the Kill skill, just have Phoenix Downs (or Raise, if needed) to bring your dead back to continue the fight rather than healing since Kill can't be stopped.

**Big Game Hunter I** (Bestiary?): I unlocked this when I started fighting Zalera. Your mileage may vary, as usual, but if you are keeping up with hunts and getting espers as you go, this will unlock eventually.

**A Chase Through the Woods** (Hunts): The Vorpal Bunny appears in Golmore Jungle - Rustling Chapel as you walk through the area and immediately flee. As you chase, it may double back toward you, but typically it will try to get away. If it gets too far, it will despawn and restore its health. If you have Berserk, inflicting Vorpal Bunny with it will stop its running and fight. Add Blind to help it miss and take it down easily. Otherwise, just continue to chase. It doesn't have too much health. It is only weak to Holy magic, so physical attacks are probably your best bet here even though it can be hard to hit. Ranged attacks with guns/arrows/bolts is ideal but magic can work too despite being halved if that's all you have available.
- If you can't seem to catch the Vorpal Bunny and are gaining levels too quickly during the chase, consider waiting to do this until after raising the level cap with the Sochen Cave Palace boss challenge. This is when I waited to do this hunt.

**Show Off I (cont'd)**: There is a very good chance that while chasing the Vorpal Bunny you'll kill all of the enemies in the area which will spawn a bunch of Dark Skeletons and then eventually the rare game Grave Lord. You WILL gain levels quickly if you are doing this before the fight with Ahriman in Sochen Cave Palace so consider putting it off until later if levels get too high.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: You'll find the map urn with the map for The Feywood in the Walk of Stolen Truths zone. Collect it to make getting this statue easier.

**Show Off I (cont'd)**: In The Feywood - Walk of Stolen Truth, if you kill most or all of the Tartarus and a bunch of Cerberus, the Crypt Bunny will spawn as you continue to walk around the zone. It appears as a non-aggressive monster so your party will not immediately attack it when it spawns. Once you do start to attack it, the Crypt Bunny will continuously flee from you, similar to the Vorpal Bunny. Fortunately, the Crypt Bunny does not immediately hide when far enough away, but it can still regain health when no longer under threat so continue to give chase until it is defeated. Tracking down this fiend is made more difficult by the distorted minimap in the zone which does not show monster locations on it.

**Show Off I (cont'd)**: After fighting Rafflesia and heading south into the White Magick's Embrace zone, if your game's clock is between 0 and 10 minutes, the rare game Juggernaut will spawn. I missed the time by four minutes so I have to come back for this one later.

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: Upon entering the Ancient City of Giruvegan and the cutscene, you'll find a Teleport Save Crystal on the linear path. Interact and register!

**Hunter of Monsters III** (Bestiary): While descending into Giruvegan I finally unlocked this achievement. I felt like I was on the cusp of getting this one unlocked forever.

**Mist Walker** (Sky Pirate's Den): I unlocked this during the fight with Shemhazai with the Whiteout concurrence. The most complicated concurrence, Black Hole, was unlocked in an earlier fight (with Lindwyrm, I think?). Getting all of the concurrences is a matter of luck with rerolls and mist charges. Give it time and make use of quickenings when possible to increase the odds that you will eventually unlock this.

**Attain to Your Birth Right!** (Progression): Defeat Shemhazai and receive the Treaty-Blade.

### Attain to Your Birth Right! ➡️ Is there a Doctor in the House

***Level Cap Reminder***: Level 50 is still the level cap. Reddas joins the party at this point. As long as your average level is 48 or less, you will still be under the level cap here. The boss for this cap is only two boss fights away, but there is some distance between here and that fight will have plenty of fiends along the way with tons of experience. Make use of Firefly accessories or escaping to get there before Reddas exceeds level 50. However, Firefly doesn't affect Reddas so he'd still gain experience from any battles.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: The map urn for Ridorana Cataract can be found in future home of Yiazmat, the Colosseum zone. It'll be found in an alcove to the northwest of the central circle.

**Show Off I (cont'd)**: A Pallicant (Nightmare type monster) will spawn in Ridorana Cataract - City of Other Days if you first eliminate all enemies in the zone, then leave and reenter the zone. It'll be found at the center crossroads.

**Trip to the City the Other Day** (Steal/Poach): Before killing Pallicant, steal from it! It has one item, the Gastrophetes, in its rare steal slot. Put on Thief's Cuffs on one or two characters and steal away while the non-stealers heal.

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: After defeating the dragon zombie, Hydro, and entering The Pharos, a Teleport Save Crystal is found near the central elevator to the left.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: The map urn for the First Ascent is found in the Wellspring Labyrinth in the central area.

**Shikari Striker** (Characters?): This milestone achievement was unlocked during the Pharos climb. As long as you are persistent with having a Steal gambit set up, you'll certainly have this one unlocked as you approach the endgame.

**Beast My Guest III** (Challenge): Unlike the previous guest character challenges, you should be in a good position with spells to be able to buff the party up. Applying Protect, Bubble, Bravery, and Haste are good to start things off, though they won't last through the battle. Once buffs are applied, turn off gambits on the party members (Reddas can still have his on), arrange Reddas' own gambits to perform appropriate healing with items that the party cannot leverage. Spirit of Lowtown, which also gives the Bravery buff, is part of a gambit that Reddas already has set. It could be useful to adjust that to just target Self so that Reddas reapplies the buff if you have the resources to cover it. If you happen to have any Baltoro's Seed, this could be a great item to use to kick off the buffs for Reddas as well. Aeroga Motes could be useful as well as Pandaemonium is weak to the element, though it's better to manually use it unless you manage to have a large stock of them. You MUST have party gambits off and all preparation done BEFORE entering the Threshold of Night door. Unfortunately, you cannot prepare before activating the boss in the dunes area.
- This was rough. Like really rough... It is slow and painful because Reddas' damage output is not great and you need to keep the other three party members alive in order to distract Pandaemonium from attack Reddas too much. The party characters can die without invalidating the achievement challenge, but if Reddas dies, it's over. If getting petrify off the other characters becomes too annoying, perhaps put Fuzzy Miters on them to prevent that issue and allow Reddas to focus more on damage output.
- One strategy proposed by RA user [d13sel](https://retroachievements.org/user/d13sel) is to take advantage of how slow Pandaemonium is by tanking control of the character being targeted (watch for the red aggro line or the character whose name is red) and then running away from the boss for as long as you can to prolong it's attack. It will eventually shift targets if it cannot reach the target so keep an eye on when that happens. This is something I ended up using to great effect throughout my winning attempt.
- A lot of comments suggest getting Dark Energy/Dark Matter+Knots of Rust to deal with this. Unfortunately, this really may be the best option. There is a chest in Cerobi Steppe - North Liavell Hills that has a small possibility of spawning with a Dark Energy in it. It is very close to the southernmost entrance to the zone so you can very easily enter the zone, see if the chest is there, and if not, leave and reenter quickly. I got two Dark Energy this way in about an hour. That is pretty exceptional luck to get those in that amount of time though. For my winning attempt, I ended up manually taking down Pandaemonium to about two-thirds health and then using the two Dark Energies to take out the remaining HP. After the first, it put up Perfect Defense paling so I had to wait for it to run out before using the second.
- ***New Level Cap***: The final level cap until the end of the game! Do not exceed level 60 until completing the remaining boss challenges (Belito hunt, Gabranth 1 & 2, Cid 2, and Vayne).

**Reflecting the Dead** (Treasure?): There is a guaranteed one-time chest in Pharos Second Ascent - Station of Banishment with an Opal Ring. It's [chest 2 on the map](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1292596668) found in a room south and center-left.

**Libra's Hunt** (Treasure?): There is a guaranteed one-time chest in Pharos Second Ascent - Station of Suffering with the Gastrophetes S crossbow. It's [chest 16 on the map](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1292596668) found in a hallway north and center-left. DO NOT SELL THIS WEAPON! It is one of the 12 weapons for the **F.I.N.A.L. F.A.N.T.A.S.Y.** achievement and you must keep them all in your inventory!

**Stain is Mine to Bear** (Challenge): This one isn't too bad. My Basch, a Knight, was level 46 and Reddas at level 50. Buffed up prior to the fight with Bubble, Protect, Haste, and Bravery, I made short work of Gabranth. Make sure that only Basch and Reddas are active in the party and that Reddas' gambits are off. Once the battle begins and you start to attack, manually direct Reddas to attack as well. At 50% HP, a cutscene will play and then the battle resumes. You'll have to manually direct Reddas again to attack after that while Basch will continue to follow your gambit actions. If Basch is a magic user, do note that Gabranth will put up a paling that blocks magic damage for two minutes so you may be dependent on Reddas as your primary damage source during that time.
- Unfortunately, this achievement is not compatible with the following challenge with Cid and Famfrit. You will have to reset and do this fight again with only Balthier and Reddas.

**Fool of a Pirate** (Challenge): I skipped the cutscene that followed after Gabranth's defeat and the challenge achievement icon appeared to let me know that I had everything set up properly. Unlike the Gabranth challenge, Reddas can have his gambits on and should be used to support Balthier as much as possible. Make sure your gambits are set to target the enemy with the highest HP so that Famfrit is the primary target when they shows up.
- The first phase with just Cid should be similar to Gabranth in how it plays out. If buffs are wearing out, reapply them however you can, either with motes or spells, if Balthier has access to them.
- Phase two of this fight begins when Cid reaches 50% HP. Famfrit is summoned and Cid is invulnerable. Shift attacks to Famfrit and, if possible, target it's fire elemental weakness. If Balthier is a magic user, ensure Reddas can remove Silence with Echo Herbs or wear the Rose Corsage accessory. Cid will buff Famfrit, but there isn't really anything that can be done about that... This will be the longest part of this fight. Because my Balthier is a white mage, I ended up equipping him with the Treaty-Blade to do the physical damage, since his Holy Rod does no damage.
- Once Famfrit is down, resume the attack on Cid just like in the first phase. Switch weapons again to whatever is more effective for Cid than for Famfrit, if necessary. Feel free to close this out with quickenings as well once Cid nears death.

**Mage's Whisperings** (Characters?): I got this milestone achievement during the refight with Gabranth before the Cid/Famfrit challenge fight with Balthier as he flung spells. This will certainly be unlocked near the endgame or absolutely during the postgame RA set cleanup.

### Is there a Doctor in the House ➡️ Zodiac Age

**Race of Rikken** (Minigame): After all the cutscenes and back in Balfonheim port with control of Vaan, chat with Rikken. Talk to him one more time and he'll ask to start a race minigame. Accept and you'll be told how to play (rapidly alternate tapping on Cross and Circle buttons). Do just that and win to unlock this achievement. I'll be coming back to work on the other tiers and their associated achievements later.

**Double-Bladed Knife** (Bazaar): Sell 5 Windslicer Pinion, 7 Malboro Flower, and 9 Wind Crystal to unlock the Double-bladed Knife in the bazaar. Purchase it for 7500 gil to get the Zwill Crossblade and this achievement.

**Magepower Helm** (Bazaar): Sell 5 Charger Barding, 2 Chimera Head, and 1 Feystone to unlock Magepower Helm in the bazaar. Purchase it for 7500 gil to get the Magepower Shishak and this achievement.

**Quell a Brother's Hatred** (Challenge): You can walk onto the lift without having set up for the challenge ahead of time. The lift gives you time to make the setup and you'll know that you are good to go when you leave and reenter the lift and the challenge achievement icon appears. If you don't have all of your mist charges before activating the lift, consider using an elixir to restore them as you'll need to use quickenings to finish the fight. You can set up buffs while on the elevator. If Basch can't apply the buffs, set it up with another character, then step off the lift and return to restore the active challenge indicator. Once ready and the challenge is active, press the button on the lift to head to the boss fight!
- At 50% HP, a cutscene occurs and then Gabranth uses Renew to restore his HP to full. Keep at it and if buffs start to drop off, renew them with whatever means you have as you go.
- The second time at 50% HP, Gabranth gets faster and resists more damage. If you need to use support items like Elixirs to restore health, do so. At 20% HP, Gabranth begins to combo even more. Stay alive!
- Elixirs can also be used to spam quickenings. Start a set of quickenings when Gabranth gets close to death or is too aggressive. If you can't get a chain long enough to kill him, use an Elixir then run through quickenings again. Repeat until it is done.
- If you happen to have Reverse or Reverse Motes available, this battle can be greatly simplified as all of Gabranth's attacks will heal you. This is especially useful in the final leg as Gabranth becomes enraged.
- If you want to not lose all of the elixirs you used here so that you can have them for Ashe vs. Vayne and you were successful in getting this achievement, then reset and do the run again and just murder Gabranth quickly with a full team.

**Game of Thrones** (Challenge):After defeating Gabranth the final time, setup Ashe solo, doing the usual buffing prior to using the lift again. You'll know that you are set up properly if you activate the lift and the active challenge icon appears as the cutscene loads.
- Similar to Gabranth, using Elixirs to heal up and restore mist charges can be helpful since you aren't going to lose them anyway as there is no "end game save" system in Final Fantasy XII. Prep a gambit to use them if you have the quantity to support it, or just pop them manually when needed explicitly for the mist charges or urgent health. Reverse is also a great idea, if available.
- Got Dark Energy/Knots of Rust+Dark Matter? Perhaps give those a use during The Undying to get his health down to 20% HP (you'll know you reached that point when it uses Perfect Defense paling). Then start using quickening spam with elixirs.
- Did you happen to get a Baltoro's Seed? The Undying is a perfect time to use that as well!
- First phase: Vayne is combo happy (especially after 50% HP) so if you have a shield user, that can be a boon. If not, having the extra health from Bubble/Bubble Belt could keep you alive. Larsa is here as well to provide some support, though you can't quite control it so you should really rely on yourself only to keep yourself healthy. If you can Blind him, that will also be beneficial to surviving the combos. Keep your health up through the end of the fight as phase two is coming up next...
- Second phase: Gabranth joins you for this part. Spells will be used against you now, so Shell is a good buff if accessible. Vayne is joined by five Sephira which can be a distraction for a melee based Ashe as they are difficult to target. If your Ashe is melee, consider using a Mote that can damage them. The biggest concern with the Sephira are their ability to immobilize and that they have different elemental affinities. If you have AoE Motes or use spells that are wind or neutral element, that could be a way to get rid of the Sephira. A fantastic time to use AoEs or high damage Motes likes Scathe is when Vayne is using one of the Vortice moves. All of the Sephira gather around Vayne, making it easy to hit all of them at once. Dispel Vayne's buffs if possible at the start and after the 50%-ish HP cutscene. After 50%-ish, Vayne is immune to magic for two minutes so focus on physicals or buffing up Gabranth to do the physicals.
- Third phase: The first time I tried this and went into the third phase, the active challenge icon was gone. I had thought that this meant that this achievement was only for the first two phases. When I tried the second time, I killed Vayne on the second phase with a quickening. The active challenge icon remained into the third phase. So, I guess you have to kill phase two and three with quickenings?? Very odd... The Undying will alternate between having physical and magical immunity. Keep an eye on the type of damage that is able to be used and alternate as possible. If you can only do one type of damage, use the off round to heal up or just run around to avoid attacks. The big thing to watch for is Teraflare (The Undying IS composed of parts from Sky Fortress Bahamut and looks a bit like Bahamut with gun wings, after all) so you'll need to ensure your health is high enough to withstand that. Make use of Bubble! Note that there is NO health bar to use for this leg of the fight. That means that you have to be careful to not kill him until you use a quickening. You'll know he's at 20% HP when he is flashing red, uses Perfect Defense, and then uses Teraflare when that wears out. Another avenue for damage is Gil Toss, since money doesn't matter at this point. Pay to win! If things aren't working out, consider working on getting better equipment via the bazaar and then trying again. Good luck!

***NOTE***: After beating the game and the credits role, start the game in Strong Mode! This will allow you to get the **Reks Smash** achievement and then make a new save with Strong Mode enabled in case you want to use it for some of the clean up.

### Zodiac Age ➡️ Postgame

**Reks Smash** (???): Start a game in Strong Mode after the credits roll. Quickly go through the tutorial to the first "boss" and destroy it quickly to get this achievement. Just attack a few times to win.

It's time for a **WORLD TOUR**! The goal for now is to go around the world, starting from Cerobi Steppe, while getting all of the trophy and rare game as well as Espers. This will be the opportunity to grind trophy game for their rare steals needed for some of the critical pieces of loot to complete the bazaar. Late game bosses will be after completing this world tour and most of the bazaar.

**Conquerer** (Sky Pirate's Den): The description states "learning every License" in the game and on the RA site, but the actual requirement is earning 48,000 license points. Some people may get this before the end of the game. I got it shortly after finishing and starting up the postgame grind at my final save point.

**The Sky is Falling** (Items?): Collecting Meteorites typically involves using the Diamond Armlet on your party leader and opening treasure chests with a 5% chance of the Meteorite being the item to find. Otherwise, you'll get money or a Knot of Rust instead.
- Meteorite A and B types are all over the place. Find a convenient place to spawn close to where a chest will appear most of the time and rezone while checking the chest and hope to get the Meteorite you are looking for.
- Type C is rarer. I used the chest (chest 42 on the [maps](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1292596668)) near the northeast exit of Zertinan Caverns - Drybeam Cavern, though I'm sure there is some other chest that is better.
- Type D is the rarest. Here are the locations that you can find the chests with them:
  - Cerobi Steppe - Feddik River: Chest 57, the northern most chest. The chest itself has a 10% chance of even spawning, so it's not very good odds.
  - Tchita Uplands - Sundered Earth: Chest 67, located in the southern central section of the zone. It also only has a 10% chance of spawning, so the Cerobi Steppe chest is slightly better because of it's vicinity to a zone entrance.
  - Dalmasca Westersand - Shimmering Horizons: Chest 20, located near the center of the zone. The center exit north is probably a good spot to rezone for trying to get this. The chest only has a 2% spawn rate, which is just awful...
  - Henne Mines - Phase 2 Dig: Chest 28, a 2% spawn rate, but it is a one time chest with a *guaranteed* Meteorite type D if it spawns and you wear the Diamond Armlet! This is the one that I used to get the achievement.
  - The Great Crystal - Many locations: Quite a few chests (check the maps) with a 5% spawn rate. If the Meteorite chest appears, the four different Meteorites fill all four slots. With the Diamond Armlet, type D is still the in the rare slot, as opposed to type A. Fortunately, these chests also have a lower chance of being a money chest. These could be good candidates to grind for the type D Meteorite.
  - ***TODO***: Any others???

**A Good Sand Scrub** (Challenge) and **A Dark Rumor** (Hunts): The final level cap challenge and it is associated with a hunt as well! The hunt, Belito, is a trap for the clan because Ba'Gamnan knew that Balthier was taking part in hunts. It's time for Balthier to solo Ba'Gamnan and his party!
- There isn't a convenient save spot near this battle unfortunately. Traveling through Zertinan Caverns can be harrowing for a low level party, but you shouldn't be low level by this point. Since this is the last level cap, it's probably a good idea to get up to or close to level 60. It can't hurt to help surviving the onslaught.
- Normally, Ba'Gamnan will focus on Balthier if he is present in the party. Since Balthier is the ONLY character, that doesn't matter. You will be joined by Monid from the clan, so it isn't actually a solo battle, but Balthier is still going to get hounded by the enemy party and especially Ba'Gamnan. Prepare by putting on the usual buffs prior to leaving Zertinan Caverns - The Canopy of Clay.
- Ensure your gambits are set up to do your strongest damage. Strongest spells, strongest healing, re-upping buffs, etc. Make use of your elixirs to quickly heal if needed (I recommend resetting and doing this battle with a full party afterword to preserve the items used).
- Quickenings are allowed. Make use of them to help reduce numbers of Ba'Gamnan's cronies.
- Dark Matter/Dark Energy is also a great contender to quickly decimate Ba'Gamnan's lackeys, if you have one to spare. They will be killed with one, making the fight balance skew back in your favor.

**Proof of the Hunt: Shelled** (Trophy Game): The Thalassinon is a tortoise type trophy game that is required to be fought first in the Hunt Club's trophy game side quest. Check out [the Hunt Club section](#hunt-club) for more details about how this works.
- To find it, go to Phon Coast - The Vaddu Strand. Head up a cliff on the far east side of the zone and look out over the beach below. It can appear right away or take about a minute or so for it to spawn. Once spawned, you can head down and encounter it.
- This is also the first trophy game that has rare loot needed for the bazaar that can be manipulated to gather the required resources easily. Set up gambits to steal with Thief's Cuffs on two characters and have them both stealing while having a third character with only healing gambits as well as Stona and Protectga. Steal an Adamantite from the monster and then run two zones away. Return and repeat. You need three total for two bazaar goods (or only two if you want to unlock both of them at once). Adamantite can be obtained from Adamantitan as well (as a grimoire drop, but at least this is guaranteed).
- As for the combat, I'm not going to cover the details of that since, in the postgame, the shackles are off and you can use whatever skills and weapons you want to take down these beasts. Have fun!

**Proof of the Hunt: Clawed** (Trophy Game): The Skullash is an Aevis type trophy game found in Phon Coast - Cape Tialan. When the Hunt Club trophy game is active, it has a 40% chance of spawning near the southern exit, around where a bunch of Pyrolisk hang out. You have to walk into this area in order for it to appear. Rezone until it shows up.
- The Skullash has Charger Barding that can be stolen. You need 9 of them for two recipes (or 5 if you wait on purchasing bazaar goods that it unlocks). It can drop or be stolen from a quite a few other enemies as well so it isn't as important to try to get the item from it.

**Show Off I (cont'd)**: The Apsara is a fish type rare game found in Phon Coast - The Mauleia Strand. It appears once 10 Piranha have been killed in the Phon Coast. The best place to farm the Piranhas is in The Vaddu Strand zone. You don't have to chain them for the rare game to spawn.

**Proof of the Hunt: Odiferous** (Trophy Game): The Kris is a Malboro type trophy game found in Tchita Uplands - The Highlands. It has a 40% chance of spawning when entering the zone instead of one of the Malboro Overkings that inhabit the two large ruin buildings in the area. The southern exit is the ideal place to try to spawn Kris, since it is close to a building that a ton of Malboro Overking spawn at.
- Kris doesn't have any exceptional items to steal from it.

**Proof of the Hunt: Whiskered** (Trophy Game): Grimalkin is a Coeurl type trophy game found in Tchita Uplands - Uazcuff Hills. It has a 10% chance of spawning instead of any of the other Coeurl that appear in the zone.
- It doesn't have any exceptional items to steal from it.

**Show Off I (cont'd)**: A rare frog type monster called Tarasque will appear in Tchita Uplands - Garden of Life's Circle after a chain of 20 or more Serpents has been hit in the area. The best way to do this is to run around this zone as it has only Serpents and a Lizard. Avoid the Lizard hanging out by the northern exits and kill all of the Serpents. If you didn't hit the chain target, run through the northwest exit and past the save crystal (don't use it!) into the second zone, then back into Garden of Life's Circle to continue the chain of Serpents. After 20 chain, the rare game will spawn near the Lizard.

**Proof of the Hunt: Ensanguined** (Trophy Game): Anubys is an Abysteel/bat type trophy game found in Sochen Cave Palace - Mirror of the Soul, in the room where the Megalixir is found after solving the Pilgrim's Door puzzle first. If you have done the puzzle once before, you must do it again for the game to appear.
- The have Vampyr Fang to steal, which 3 are needed for the Crimson Blade bazaar package. Abysteel also drop them with the grimoire so it isn't urgent to farm from Anubys.

**Proof of the Hunt: Frigid** (Trophy Game): Wendice is a headless humanoid type trophy game found in Sochen Cave Palace - Destiny's March. Run around the outside of the central area, similar to how you unlock the passage to the Hell Wyrm. Kill Wendigos until you see a red dot appear in the center room. About 5 or so Wendigos should be enough for Wendice to spawn.
- The Wendice has a Gemini Gem to steal, which isn't remarkable as it can be obtained by steal or drop from multiple sources.

**Archer's Bane** (Characters?): This milestone achievement unlocks as soon as you hit 500,000 steps. That's a lot of steps! Happy walking! You will undoubtedly unlock this during the postgame trophy/rare game hunting and gathering materials for the bazaar unlocks.

**Proof of the Hunt: Adamantine** (Trophy Game): THIS IS ONE OF THE IMPORTANT GAME TO FARM FROM!!! The Aspidochelon is found in Cerobi Steppe - Feddik River. It has a 40% chance of replacing one of the Adamantitan in this zone. Once found, FARM SCARLETITE! You want 5 Scarletite (3 if you are not buying the bazaar packages until the end) for crafting the Gemsteel needed to make Tournesol and Masamune I.

**Exemplar** (Sky Pirate's Den): Get an average level of 50 for the party to unlock this achievement.

**Show Off I (cont'd)**: The Etherian is a flan type rare game that appears in Cerobi Steppe - The Northsward. Killing all fiends in the zone will cause it to spawn right near your party.
- You can farm this rare game by leaving and reentering the zone immediately. As long as you don't go two zones away, all monsters stay dead so the requirement for Etherian to spawn stays. It has a chance to drop Silver Liquid so this is a good way to get the 11 you need (5 if doing the bazaar trick) fairly quickly. It will respawn between windmills 9 and 10 after rezoning.
- This is also an opportunity to pick up the Ageworn Key at Windmill 10 if you have defeated Vyraal and got the dragon scale as part of your reward.

**Proof of the Hunt: Cruel** (Trophy Game): The Bluesang is a headless humanoid type trophy game that is found in Cerobi Steppe - Crossfield. It has a 40% chance to spawn between the two windmills that are near the northern exit. There are four traps that are between these two windmills, but fortunately Bluesang tends to hang out just south of them.
- This is another good candidate for farming their item: Damascus Steel. They are used to make Gemsteel and 2 are required for each Gemsteel. Since you need to create 5 Gemsteel (3 with the bazaar trick), you will want to have 10 Damascus Steel (6 with the bazaar trick). It is possible to farm them from the Bune enemy in Pharos, but that won't be as reliable as this. It may be a good idea to clear out the surrounding monsters before attempting to steal the Damascus Steel. It'll be a bit slower, but safer. However, if you are capable of tanking or resisting the status effects of the nearby riff raff, just go for the steal instead.

**Floating Arrow of Doom** (???): Enter Cerobi Steppe - Old Elanise Road with the Seitengrat equipped to unlock this achievement. The arrow itself can be found floating near the northern exit of the zone, by where chest 99 can spawn. Check the [maps](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1292596668) for more details of the exact location.

**Carrot Stalk** (Hunts): To make Carrot the overgrown Malboro appear, you need to reach The Salikawood - Sun-dappled Path without having killed any monsters enroute to the location upon entering The Salikawood. Just turn off attack gambits and run through from your starting location to the zone. You'll know you are successful if the viera waiting for you tells you that you got there without making a racket.
- As stated earlier, I'm not really going to delve into actual combat techniques with hunts and such at this point since restrictions are off and you can handle it however. I simply used my Seitengrats to eliminate Carrot quickly without the hassle.

**Proof of the Hunt: Sickle** (Trophy Game): The Rageclaw is a mantis type trophy game that can be found in The Salikawood - Piebald Path. It will spawn when you hang out on the southern path for about a minute or so without killing any other monsters in the zone, appearing on the western path. If you did kill a monster, move two zones away and then try again. Once 60 seconds have elapsed, you can kill monsters at this point and proceed to where Rageclaw should appear. It can technically spawn at any opposite exit from where you wait.
- You can steal Sickle-Blade from it, which you need 2 of for the Orochi N bazaar good. If you don't have two of these already, I recommend getting them now from this trophy game.

**Show Off I (cont'd)**: A Wood Toad rare game will appear in The Salikawood - Corridor of Ages with a 20% spawn rate. It can be found close to the northern exit on a side path as you head south. It is invisible however, so it will be hard to find. While invisible, you won't be able to target it. You can hear it walking around and see a distortion. To actually attack it, you need to have someone with Reflect status and bounce a spell off of them to hit it. At that point, you can then hit it with physical attacks.

**Proof of the Hunt: Vengeful** (Trophy Game): The Arioch is a gargoyle type trophy game that appears in Nabreus Deadlands - The Slumbermead. It will appear in the southeast at a 40% chance of spawning.
- It has a Sage's Ring to steal, if you wish to have more than one.

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: The final Teleport Save Crystal is in Nabreus Deadlands - Succor Midst Sorrow. It is also a Crystalbug that is very strong, using Dark magic spells. Don't mess around and kill it quickly. Once you defeated it and the real save crystal appears, interact with it and this achievement will unlock.

**Show Off I (cont'd)**: The secret area of Nabreus Deadlands - The Fog Mutters has a rare game that only spawns when at least one character in your party has less than 20% HP remaining (called HP Critical). Velelu is a zombie type rare game and will spawn near the entrances to the zone. Probably the easiest way to make this happen is to turn off healing gambits and then attack yourself to the HP critical range or kill a party member and use a phoenix down. Velelu is also notable because it has a low chance of dropping the Durandal, which is associated with the **Sword of the Fog** achievement.

**Sword of the Fog** (Treasure?): This is unfortunate, as the best way to make the drop happen is to chain zombie/banshee type enemies to a max chain and then make Velelu spawn and kill it. Max chain means only a 7% chance of getting Durandal, but that is certainly better than 1% with no chain.
- You can also chain the Dead Bones in the Overlooking Eternity zone and then apply that chain to killing Velelu. It appears that does in fact affect the drops of the monster that breaks the chain!
- Keep in mind that Velelu will only spawn once per visit to Nabreus Deadlands. You will have to leave the area and return to fight it and try to get the sword again...

**Scalp the Golden Skull** (Steal/Poach): The numerous Dead Bones that spawn in Nabreus Deadlands - Overlooking Eternity are the target for this achievement. The Golden Skullcap helmet is a rare steal from them. Put on Thief's Cuffs, perhaps two characters with them, and start stealing while another character is killing them. Since these enemies have other items to steal, this makes for a slight RNG nightmare, though the quantity of enemies certainly helps. If you clear out the zone of Dead Bones, head out two zones away and return to try again. If it takes a while, expect to gain a lot of experience.

**Adding Insult to Injury** (Hunts): The Roblon mark is hiding in Nabreus Deadlands - Overlooking Eternity, a hidden zone associated with the Medallions side quest. 

**Bushi Basher** (Milestones): The Dead Bones in Nabreus Deadlands - Overlooking Eternity are an excellent way to get to 200 chain for this achievement. I ended up coupling that with **Sword of the Fog** and **Scalp the Golden Skull**.

**The Creature Collector** (Hunts): Right near the entrance to Necrohol of Nabudis - Hall of Slumbering Might from the Deadlands is the Goliath, a golem type mark. It has a very high defense so even with Seitengrat it will take a fair amount of time to kill.

**Show Off I (cont'd)**: The rare game Helvinek is a nightmare type fiend that can appear anywhere in Necrohol of Nabudis. For it to spawn, you must defeat 6 Oversouls, which randomly appear after killing enemies throughout the area. Once the 6 are defeated, Helvinek will show up. This rare game also has a rare drop of Grand Armor, which is needed to get the **Hell Horse Armor** achievement.
- One strategy that people are using to make this drop happen is to lure Helvinek close to a zone exit. If you kill the monster and then zone out before the experience and license points appear, Helvinek will appear in the next zone. Repeat this to get the chain up and improve your chance of getting the drop. Of course, if a drop happens, you should also grab it as you zone out.

**Love's Fury** (Side Quest): As part of the Medallions quest, you must fight Fury in Necrohol of Nabudis. If you have access to Dispel, you'll take out Fury very easily. Just don't let your Dispel caster get Berserk status.

**???** (Characters? Side Quest? Not sure...): The Esunaga spell becomes available in the secret Baknamy Merchant's shop after defeating Hydro at the Pharos entrance. Purchase it to unlock this achievement.

**Bravery's Horror** (Side Quest): As part of the Medallions quest, you must fight Humbaba Mistant in Necrohol of Nabudis. Protect and Dispel are critical, given the buffs on the boss and it's penchant for physical attacking. Defeating both this and Fury unlocks the final key in the Medallions quest, providing access to the Esper Chaos!

**The Walker of the Wheel** (Espers): Chaos is found in Necrohol of Nabudis, locked behind a door requiring the Medallion of Might, the final piece of the Medallions side quest. Prepare with the usual buffs as well as a gambit to deal with the Confuse status, preferably on someone who has a Bowline Sash. Protection from Disable is also helpful with the Black Belt.
- The main gimmick of the fight is that you can't use Attack. Chaos is surrounded by elementals that are affected by their opposing element while Chaos itself is only affected by earth element or non-elemental spells. Technicks such as Telekinesis and Soul Eater are good too.

**Uhlan's Mission** (Milestones): Earn 2 million clan points to unlock this achievement.

**Maximum Elvor-drive** (Items? Treasure?): Elvoret has a very rare chance of dropping Maximillian. I got very lucky and it dropped without a chain level bonus. Chaining Elvoret could be feasible by setting up gambits to only attack monsters with a wind weakness but you'll need to be a higher level and aggressively healing.

**Proof of the Hunt: Gravesoil** (Trophy Game): To get Vorres, a floating skull trophy game, to appear in Necrohol of Nabudis - Hall of the Ivory Covenant, you need to aggro a Dark Elemental that only appears near the door to Fury rarely. Once aggro'd escort it past the door to the other side of the passage and Vorres will appear. Some resources mention bringing the Dark Elemental TO the door, but that is not correct. Simply go past the door with the elemental.
- Vorres has Soul Powder as a rare steal, which is a necessary loot for making Empyreal Soul for the Tournesol. That means that you will need 3 of them in total. You can also get Soul Powder from Etém in Henne Mines (it's a grimoire drop or a rare steal). Given how painful it can be to farm Soul Powder from Vorres, it can make sense to get the rest from the Etém. You do get one Soul Powder as a reward from completing the hunt of Ixtab.

**Dead City Watch** (Hunts): Deathscythe, another of the floating skull type enemies, is found in Necrohol of Nabudis - Cloister of the Highborn, right by where the Ensanguined Shield chest spawns. To make it appear, you have to drop the HP of a character to critical range. It will put up a physical paling at 50% HP so use non-elemental spells.

**Reks' Legacy** (Side Quest): Complete five hunts given by residents in Nalbina: Trouble in the Hills, Adding Insult to Injury, Dead City Watch, The Creature Collector, and Carrot Stalk. When reporting to the people who posted the hunts, they call out to Jovy, a seeq, about the results of the hunt. Every time, Jovy looks at Vaan and runs off. After the fifth time, look for Jovy running around in West Ward and talk to them. You'll have a conversation about Jovy's inspiration and then this achievement unlocks.

**Show Off I (cont'd)**: A Grey Molter can appear on Mosphoran Highwaste - Empyrean Way when the south shrine in the Bubbling Vale is active, creating a floatweed path to the eastern section of the zone. However, it will only spawn when the game clock minutes are between 10 and 20. Grey Molter is a snake type monster and is hidden until you get close to its spawn point. If you are in the zone when the timer is between 10 and 20 minutes and you can't find it while wandering the area, leave the zone and return and try again.

**Mirage a Trois** (Steal/Poach): The trophy game Dheed and Disma have the Mirage Vest that can be stolen from them as a rare steal. Dheed is located at Mosphoran Highwaste - Skyreach Ridge while Disma is found at Lhusu Mines - Site 5 and Site 6 South. Setup characters to not have attack gambits while one or two characters with Thief's Cuffs are on stealing duty. Disma's appearance is a bit more difficult to contend with, since it spawns in those locations in the place of the many Dark Lords in the zones and can pop up unexpectedly, more so than Dheed. Also, Disma is much more difficult compared to Dheed. I highly recommend Dheed for getting this achievement.

**Proof of the Hunt: Leathern** (Trophy Game): Dheed is a wyvern type trophy game found at Mosphoran Highwaste - Skyreach Ridge. It has a 40% spawn chance with every entry into the zone. Since the zone is a steep climb toward the area's summit, it may be hard to see the monster is there at first as your camera will often be facing the ground as you head toward the summit exit. The zone is also full of bird type fiends so it may be hard to identify that Dheed is even there until you have killed it or realize that it is taking a lot longer to defeat this one enemy compared to the others. The problem with this is that Dheed is one of the two trophy game tied to the **Mirage a Trois** missable achievement. Make sure you steal your Mirage Vest from the fiend (or more than one if you want to get more) otherwise you'll need to get it from Disma instead (perhaps you may prefer getting it from that trophy game instead too).

**The Judge-Sal** (Espers): Exodus can be found at Mosphoran Highwaste - Empyrean Seat. Getting there is a puzzle in itself. Once you have gained access to Phon Coast for the first time, the shrines in the Bubbling Vale will become active. Using shrines will cause floatweed to create new paths around surrounding zones. Up to three can be active at any one time. Activate the following shrines: East Wind, Northeast Wind, and South Wind. Ride on the chocobo found at the Rays of Ashen Light zone, ride through Empyrean Way across the floatweed to a chocobo only path that leads into Skyreach Ridge. Head back into Babbling Vale, knock over the loose boulder, and activate the West Wind and Northwest Wind shrines. Now you can access Empyrean Seat.
- You cannot use items in this fight, so no Motes or Phoenix Downs. You are entirely reliant on magic for healing and damage, as well as physical attacks. Exodus loves to use Flare and Scathe. Both will do several thousand HP of damage to one or more targets. Having Bubble and Shell are good ideas, along with trying to spread your team out so that Scathe only hits one or two people. At 20% HP, a physical paling is put up AND Exodus has Reflect up. To hit Exodus now, you'll need attack magic with an Opal Ring. You can get Exodus in a loop with Dispel as the esper will try to reapply Reflect over and over again.

**Proof of the Hunt: Hide-covered** (Trophy Game): The Terror Titan is a tyrannosaur type trophy game located in Dalmasca Estersand - Broken Sands that has a 40% chance of spawning near the north exit instead of a Wild Saurian.

**Show Off I (cont'd)**: Greeden is a alligator type rare game that appears at Dalmasca Estersand - Banks of the Nebra after three real-time minutes have elapsed in the zone. It will appear in the middle of the shore area in the zone's north. This was the fiend that unlocked **Show Off I** for me.

**Show Off II** (Bestiary): The Ripe Rampager is a mandragora type rare game that spawns in Dalmasca Estersand - Yardang Labyrinth. It has a 33% chance of spawning in a dead end near the southwest exit to Outpost with each cactoid type enemy killed. There are three cactoids that spawn in when you get near to where they are in this zone. When I got Ripe Rampager to appear, I had killed two cactoid and then was approaching the third in the dead end when Ripe Rampager spawned in out of the ground. If it doesn't show up after the three cactoids are killed, run through Outpost to pass two zones and return to try again. It took a few tries to get Ripe Rampager to spawn so good luck and be persistent if it isn't showing up.

**Show Off II (cont'd)**: Minibug is a mimic type rare game that can appear in Barheim Passage - East-West Bypass. It has a 20% chance spawn rate, appearing in the eastern dead end. It does not appear as a treasure chest, so it'll be readily apparent that it has spawned since it'll be moving around.

**Proof of the Hunt: Bony** (Trophy Game): Ishteen is a reaper/floating skull type trophy game that can spawn in Barheim Passage, in either the East-West Bypass or The Zeviah Span zones. It will have a very low spawn chance initially, increasing by 2% with every 10 seconds in the zone. It also has a chance to spawn if you step on the trap in East-West Bypass that causes Disease at the intersection by the eastern zone exit.
- Ishteen has the Soul of Thamasa to steal for Tournesol creation. The fiend will spawn a couple of Dead Bones during the fight so you'll want to have a character manually pick those off while others work on stealing the item. Ishteen also loves Doom and Death, so appropriate healing gambits will also be helpful. Once stolen, you can run back to the save crystal two zones away to heal up and then repeat.

**Proof of the Hunt: Fur-scaled** (Trophy Game): Gavial is an alligator type trophy game that appears in Garamsythe Waterway - No. 10 Channel when the water is drained in the zone. Head down into the channel where water previously filled to where a one-time chest containing Hornito was located (chest 42). While in the area, Gavial will charge in from behind and attack.
- Gavial has Antarctic Wind to steal. While you'll need 2 of them, you can get them fairly easily from Feral Crocs in Tchita Uplands - Oliphzak Rise as their grimoire drop as well.

**Show Off II (cont'd)**: Drowned is a zombie type rare game that spawns in Garamsythe Waterway - No. 4 Cloaca Spur when the water is drained from the zone. To drain the water, close both sluice gates for No. 4 and No. 11 Channels. Drowned then has an increasing chance of appearing in the drained channel of the zone every 15 seconds after 5 minutes have elapsed in Garamsythe Waterway.

**The Impure** (Espers): Cúchulainn is a terrifying esper found in Garamsythe Waterway - No. 1 Cloaca. In order to access the boss, you must use the Old Sluice Key in Central Waterway Control in order to drain water from channels to access other sluice controls. Start with closing the gates to No. 10 and No. 3 channels. In No. 3 Cloaca Spur, use the No. 1 South Waterway Control to shut one of the gates for No. 1 Cloaca. Return to Central Waterway Control and swap sides, opening the sluice gates for No. 10 and 3, then shutting the gates for No. 11 and 4. Go into No. 4 Cloaca Spur to use the No. 1 North Waterway Control. Go back into Central Waterway Control and open No. 11's sluice gate while shutting No. 3 one more time. This will make all water drain out of No. 1 Cloaca. You can now reach Cúchulainn.
- One big thing to note about this boss is that there is a constant HP drain effect in the area during the fight. The esper also loves to use the Sap status effect to double the HP loss along with Disable to prevent healing. Good luck!

**Show Off II (cont'd)**: If you haven't taken out Lindbur Wolf yet, now is a perfect time to do so since making it appear and then killing it is required for **Proof of the Hunt: Fanged**. Get a chain of about 20 wolves in Dalmasca Westersand for the Lindbur Wolf to appear in the isolated section of Shimmering Horizons.

**Show Off I (cont'd)**: For completion sake, I killed Fideliant while trying to steal Gladius from Lindbur Wolf in the beginning of the game. Fideliant is a skeleton type rare game that has a 20% spawn chance in Dalmasca Westersand - The Midfault. It tends to appear near the fissure in the center of the zone, but can appear elsewhere.

**Proof of the Hunt: Fanged** (Trophy Game): The Kaiser Wolf is a wolf type trophy game that appears in Dalmasca Westersand - Corridor of Sand after the Lindbur Wolf has been dispatched while in the area. It will spawn on the lower east side of the zone.

**Show Off II (cont'd)**: Dustia is a reaper/floating skull type rare game that can appear in Dalmasca Westersand - Corridor of Sand, near the southwestern exit, when a character has less than 10% of HP remaining. It is notable for being a great early game experience point farm because it can easily be killed with a phoenix down and repeated using the zone out glitch. This isn't feasible for this achievement set because of the level caps, however.

**Show Off II (cont'd)**: Pineapple is a bomb type rare game that appears in Ogir-Yensa Sandsea - Platform 1 - Refinery. It has a 20% chance of spawning in one of six locations around the zone. Since this zone has a lot of enemies, which can reduce the chance of Pineapple appearing, I recommend sweeping through and cleaning out the zone as much as possible, rezoning, and continuing to sweep out remaining monsters. If Pineapple still doesn't show, keep rezoning and looking at the minimap for any new red spots to appear to know that you have spawned the rare game.

**Proof of the Hunt: Beaked** (Trophy Game): The Bull Chocobo is a black chocobo trophy game that appears in Ogir-Yensa Sandsea - South Tank Approach. It has a 40% chance to spawn at the southern most area of the zone. Use the western exit for rezoning until the chocobo appears.

**Proof of the Hunt: Maverick** (Trophy Game): Victanir is a horse type trophy game that appears in Nam-Yensa Sandsea - Yellow Sands. It has a 40% chance of spawning and is invisible initially.
- It is also a source of Wargod's Bands as a rare steal. These are needed for Empyreal Souls, so you will want to have 6 Wargod's Bands before killing Victanir.

**Show Off II (cont'd)**: Megabomb is a bomb type rare game found in Nam-Yensa Sandsea - Demesne of the Sandqueen. It can appear in one of several places around the zone after chaining over 20 Urutan-Yensa.

**Machinists Pleasures** (Milestones): This achievement unlocks after using a technick over 5000 times. Steal should make up a good number of these.

**Proof of the Hunt: Soulless** (Trophy Game): Zombie Lord is a trophy game that appears in The Tomb of Raithwall - Northfall Passage. It will only spawn if the minutes on the in-game clock are between 0 and 29. There are a few spots within the zone that it can spawn so you'll need to walk around to find it.

**Show Off II (cont'd)**: Cultsworn Lich is a rare game found in The Tomb of Raithwall - Southfall Passage. It only spawns when a regular Lich uses Divide, which only happens when at critical health. You can use 1000 Needles to easily put Lich down to 100 health remaining and then it will typically run off to divide. During Divide, Cultsworn Lich has a 20% chance of being summoned.
- There is a lot of different commentary on how to get Cultsworn Lich to spawn. My experience was that a Lich may use Divide a few times and then just refuse to Divide any more. When that happens, kill it and move on to find another one. Good luck!

**Hunter of Monsters IV** (Bestiary): By far, the hardest "regular" enemy in the game is Archaeoaevis. Two can be found in Zertinan Caverns - The Balamka Fault. They can spawn with a level between 50-99 and it's max HP will be unknown with Libra because it will be over 100,000. Using Ribbons on all party members is recommended because of the many status effects that they can inflict. Rezoning can be a good idea in order to check the level of the nearest archaeoaevis to find one at a lower level, but the fight will still be difficult. Using Wither could help to reduce the damage they inflict, and Blind can prevent them from even landing hits, making the fight much more bearable. Meanwhile, apply the usual buffs to the party. Keep close to the zone exit while these monsters rush to attack you so that you can hop out to heal up and then resume the fight at the same spot you left. Good luck!
- Technically, it seems that you only need to have targeted or been targeted by an enemy for it to register, but I like to have entries in the bestiary to know which enemies I actually have registered. The achievement will unlock once the last enemy targets you and vice versa.

**Paying for the Past** (Hunts): Catoblepas is found in Zertinan Caverns - Hourglass Basin, on the secret passage side of the zone.

**Show Off II (cont'd)**: Molen is a golem type rare game that will appear in Zertinan Caverns - Hourglass Basin. Go to the secret passage side and kill off the Grenades hanging around there (or Catoblepas if the hunt is active). Wait for 10 seconds, looking out over to the other side and you'll see Molen start to walk into the zone. Return back over to that side to fight it (or use Seitengrat to take it out from afar, if you wish).

**Proof of the Hunt: Fell** (Trophy Game): Alteci is a behemoth type trophy game that appears in Zertinan Caverns - The Undershore. It will only appear if the player has an active chain of 12+ when entering or while earned in The Undershore. Mallicants are a good candidate for meeting this requirement.

**Proof of the Hunt: Metallic** (Trophy Game): Killbug is a mimic type trophy game that appears as a larger than normal treasure chest.

**Show Off II (cont'd)**: In Ozmone Plain - The Shred, there is a 20% chance for Bull Croc, an alligator rare game, to spawn on the north side. Shortly after it is killed, another rare game called Aeros, a white wyvern, will fly right toward you.

**The Foebreaker** (Milestones): Kill over 7500 enemies throughout the game. This shouldn't be too hard to do during the post game as you work to build up levels, build chains for item drops, and hunt for rare and trophy game.

**Proof of the Hunt: Maned** (Trophy Game): Nazarnir is a slepnir type rare game found in the dry Giza Plains - Starfall Field. It has a 40% chance of replacing the lone Slepnir that spawns in the southeast corner of the zone. You'll know it is Nazarnir because it'll have Shell and Haste active.

**Ready to Duel** (Treasure): A Dueling Mask can be found in Henne Mines - Phase 2 Dig. Near the entrance from Ore Separation is a path not on the map with a guaranteed one-time chest containing this item, and unlocking the achievement.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: The Henne Mines candle urn is in Phase 2 Dig, revealing the remaining locations to enter.

**Piercing the Veil** (Treasure): The Fomalhaut can be found in Henne Mines - Phase 2 Dig right next to the map urn.

**Mage's Circlet** (Treasure): A Circlet can be found in a guaranteed one-time chest in Henne Mines - Phase 2 Dig in the unmarked path that connects the two sides of this zone together.

**Volcano Punch** (Treasure): The Volcano T hand bombs can be found in a guaranteed one-time chest in Henne Mines - Phase 2 Dig in the room on the map that doesn't appear connected to the rest of the zone. It looks like there is another guaranteed Volcano T can be found in the Phase 2 Shaft zone to the north of the exit to Special Charter Shaft, but I didn't see it there. Perhaps these two chests are linked?

**Show Off II (cont'd)**: Glaring Eye is a ghost/lich type rare game that appears after killing Hecteyes in Henne Mines - Crossover C and Phase 2 Shaft. It has a 10% chance to spawn with each Hecteyes killed.

**MegaStash** (Treasure): While going through Henne Mines - Phase 2 Dig, there is a discarded letter that can be found in a dead end to the far west, upper half of the zone. Read it to learn about a hidden stash. Later, in the Special Charter Shaft zone, in a dead end to the north, is a glowing red light on the ground. Examine it to find the hidden stash of 3 Bacchus's Wine and 2 Megalixirs!

**Dressed Like a Lord** (Treasure): In Henne Mines - Special Charter Shaft in a dead end west and center of the zone is a guaranteed one-time chest that contains Lordly Robes.

**Zodiac Brave** (Treasure): In Henne Mines - Special Charter Shaft, a one-time chest that has a 25% appearance rate contains a Brave Suit. It is located on the lower east side of the map, in an unmarked area that is a T-intersection with a boulder in it. The chest will appear behind the boulder if you enter the intersection from the south. It is chest 54 on the maps.

**Grand Ole Armor** (Treasure): In Henne Mines - Special Charter Shaft, a one-time chest that has a 25% appearance rate contains Grand Armor. It is located in the same spot as the hidden stash in a dead end in the north of the map. It is chest 59 on the maps.

**Proof of the Hunt: Scythe** (Trophy Game): The Biding Mantis is found in Golmore Jungle - The Needlebrake when the game clock minutes is between 30 and 59. There are one of several spots that it could spawn. It has Tattered Garments as a rare steal but you can also get them as a grimoire drop from Scythe Mantis.

**Proof of the Hunt: Mind** (Trophy Game): Ancbolder is a headless humanoid type trophy game that appears in Paramina Rift - Karydine Glacier. It has the exact same requirements to appear as the rare game Anchag in this zone: eliminate all enemies in the zone, leave and reenter, and it'll appear in the south center of the zone.

**Wyrm Wrath's Renewal** (Hunts): Fafnir is found in Paramina Rift - Silverflow's End when there is a blizzard in progress. For that to happen, you can speak with Relj, the hunt's petitioner, in Mt. Bur-Omisace and a blizzard will begin. The blizzard will maintain as long as you don't enter the Frozen Brook zone on the way to Silverflow's End. With 1.3 million HP, Fafnir will take a lot of work to whittle down but by this point the party should be able to handle it with the wide variety of skills, spells, and equipment. Once complete, return to Relj for the reward and achievement.

**Befoulment of the Beast** (Hunts): I completely forgot about this hunt during the course of the normal game and ended up finishing it during cleanup. It can certainly be completed while on the way to Stilshrine of Miriam for getting the Sword of Kings. In any case, you'll find the Feral Retriever, a coeurl type fiend, in Paramina Rift - Spine of the Icewyrm.

**Proof of the Hunt: Eternal** (Trophy Game): Myath is a dragon zombie type trophy game found in Stilshrine of Miriam - Ward of Velitation. For it to spawn, you must first eliminate all of the dragon aevis in the room, leave and reenter and it will be waiting.

**The Condemner** (Espers): Zeromus is found at Stilshrine of Miriam - Throne of the Veiled Gods. To access this chamber, you need to have received the Stone of the Condemner from an acolyte at Mr. Bur-Omisace after defeating Judge Bergan. Use the way stone at the back of the Ward of Measure zone and say that you want to use the Stone of the Condemner to go to Zeromus' chamber. Before opening the door to the boss, ensure you have non-magic gambits set up. Zeromus has an anti-magic field, preventing all spells from being used.

**Proof of the Hunt: Feathered** (Trophy Game): Dreadguard is a larger version of the Mirror Knight fiends in The Feywood - Walk of Dancing Shadow. It has a 40% chance of spawning instead of a regular Mirror Knight near the center of the zone.

**A Wild Stench** (Hunts): This large malboro is joined by four smaller ones in The Feywood - Redolent Glade. Ribbons and other preventative measures from Bad Breath are helpful.

**Show Off II (cont'd)**: Juggernaut is a golem type rare game found in The Feywood - White Magick's Embrace when the game clock minutes are between 0 and 10. It'll spawn near the north entrance.

**Truth Shrouded in Mist** (Hunts): The Behemoth King is a much worse version of Fafnir, found in The Feywood - Edge of Reason. To get it to appear, you must defeat a Giruveganus in Edge of Reason, then eliminate all monsters in Ice Field of Clearsight. Return to Edge of Reason and the spot where the Giruveganus spawned is where the Behemoth King should now be. If a Giruveganus is still spawning, kill it again and rezone and now the Behemoth King should show.

**Wyrm Booger** (Treasure): Using the hint learned by the petitioner of the Behemoth King hunt, return to Mt. Bur-Omisace - Temple Approach. A new prompt will appear as you approach the giant skull. Strike the Wyrm Snout and you'll get your real reward for the Behemoth King fight.

**Genji Theft** (Steal/Poach): Gilgamesh is an interesting fight as you are required to fight him twice and every 20% HP ticked off his health bar adds new items to steal from him. The Genji equipment shows up between 40%-20% and 20% to 0% across BOTH fights! For this challenge, this means that you have to do both battles back to back, stealing all of the Genji gear *without saving your game*. Additionally, you need to open up the chest containing the Masamune during or after the second fight.
- In order to avoid issues with enemies between zones, I bee-lined directly to Site 7 after completing the first fight with Gilgamesh on Tasche Span. If you have the Diabolos hunt active, there will be no enemies in Site 11, making this run between fights a bit easier.
- To control the stealing and phases, I turned off all attack gambits, manually issuing commands to do damage to push HP thresholds then let the steal gambits do their work until the message appeared that there is nothing to steal. Fortunately, when the Genji equipment is able to be stolen, there are no other items in the other steal slots so a successful steal *will* be Genji gear.
- Take out Enkidu first though with your strongest spells and attacks at the start of both fights.
- The first fight has the Genji Shield (40-20%) and Genji Gloves (20-0%). At 20% HP, Gilgamesh will be invulnerable for a little bit. Overall, the fight is unremarkable if your levels are high by this point (I was level 64 average).
- The second fight has the Genji Helm (40-20%) and Genji Armor (20-0%). Gilgamesh is much stronger in this fight and has level divisible spells (Level 2 Sleep, Level 3 Disable, and Level 4 Break). Make sure you use party members that are not divisible by these values! While in the final phase, Gilgamesh uses Perfect Defense. You'll be unable to do anything to him, including steal, during this period. This is a perfect opportunity to get the Masamune from the chest, if your team can keep up with healing from his attacks. If you grab the Masamune during the fight and steal the Genji Armor at the end, as long as you got every other piece, the achievement unlocks at that moment.

**Battle on the Big Bridge** (Hunts): Tell Montblanc about defeating Gilgamesh to get your reward and achievement!

**More Like a Dork** (Treasure): A guaranteed chest with the Whale Whisker can be found in Lhusu Mines - Site 6 North. It is behind the trapped chest with Maximillian in it.

**Proof of the Hunt: Accursed** (Trophy Game): Disma is a very terrifying zombie type trophy game that is fluent with spells that can quickly remove thousands of HP or outright kill a character, becoming faster as its HP gets lower. It can appear anywhere in Lhusu Mines - Site 5 or Site 6 South, replacing one of the Dead Bones that spawn here. It is considered one of the hardest of the trophy game enemies. Be ready for a battle!

**Cartography (cont'd)**: The Lhusu map candle is located in Lhusu Mines - Site 5 in the southernmost dead end. By this point, you'll have already visited all of (or most of) the locations in Lhusu Mines, but if you missed Site 6 North, this will hint to where it is.

**The Child Snatcher** (Hunts): Doing this hunt when ready for the second Gilgamesh fight makes it easy. You'll find Diabolos in Lhusu Mines - Site 11, in a dead end path to the southwest.

**Show Off II (cont'd)**: You'll need to leave and come back into Lhusu Mines - Site 11 after killing Diabolos. Kill all of the enemies in this zone, including any mimic chests, to spawn Gemhorn in the same location Diabolos was at. The mimics are located where Gemhorn spawns, by a trapped chest, as well as near the mine cart that takes you to Site 5. Gemhorn is a very large slaven type rare game that is not aggressive.

**Visitor on Deck** (Hunts): Deathgaze can be found on the passenger airships. It only has a chance of showing when you charter a flight. You can use private cabins to make things faster. After landing and no Deathgaze, talk to the kid who gave you the hunt to improve the odds of Deathgaze showing up. Keep flying and you'll get woken up to help defend the ship when it appears. Deathgaze has a fun way of being defeated since it is vulnerable to Reverse. By using Reverse, Renew, and then Cure, you can kill it very quickly without the pain of dealing with the physical palings it puts up.

The World Tour is pretty much done! Now I'm diving into Ridorana, Pharos, and Giruvegan/Great Crystal to wrap up the trophy game and rare game. Then I'll be getting my levels up in order to handle the remaining espers and bosses.

**Proof of the Hunt: Reptilian** (Trophy Game): The Abelisk is a tyrannosaur trophy game found at Ridorana Cataract - Echoes from Time's Garden. It has a 30% chance of spawning in the center of the zone with each entry.

**Who's the Strongest!?** (Hunts): Pylraster is found where Hydro was fought, in front of the entrance to the Pharos.

**Race of Balance** (Minigame): I finally got back to doing more of this after the World Tour. I learned from [Mimicmatter](https://retroachievements.org/user/mimicmatter) that the Circle and Cross buttons alternating are used to move in a straight line. If you press one of the buttons more than another, you drift in the direction that is pressed (Cross is left, Circle is right). Use this to your advantage to take the corners in the race track tighter. For example, after the start of the race, run forward a bit (until the bird dude trips the first time), then double tap Cross, then continue to alternate. This will turn Vaan toward the first corner so that you take the turn sooner. Once past that turn, tap Circle a few times to turn toward the inside of the second corner and then continue to run straight. Finally, after the final turn, straighten yourself out to get to the stairs in the shortest path and you'll win easily (at least, for these first ten races).

**Zodiac's Gift** (Treasure): Grinding to make this chest appear, along with the Addle chest, in Henne Mines - Special Charter Shaft is an excellent way to raise levels of your party. I dipped into this spot to do grinds for these chests in between wrapping up my last trophy game and rare game hunting. The Zodiac Spear chest appears on the steps leading down, just before getting into the cavern sections of the zone. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get it without defeating Zodiark first. Using Zodiark's arena as a spot to control RNG was crucial to getting the chest to spawn.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: The Pharos Subterra is accessible near the end of the game by taking the elevator from near the teleport crystal down. There is no map for this space so it is upon you to manually map out each area. Thankfully, most areas are "hidden" and won't get mapped. You just need to walk around the ring and enter the four doors of each floor. Also, make sure you kept all of the Black Orbs obtained from the First Ascent so that you can light up the spaces of the Subterra, though you can gain more from the enemies here as well as Massive Black Orbs that give a large number of them.

**God or Devil?** (Hunts): Before you can fight "The Seer", you need to have defeated Phoenix in Pharos Subterra - Penumbra North. You find it in the center of the northern rooms of this level.

**Jack-of-All-Trades** (Sky Pirate's Den): This statue unlocked after I got the Wither technick in Pharos Subterra, however, I needed to go into the Clan Primer for it to unlock the achievement. This is one of the statues that the descriptions warn about and the first that I have encountered that required explicitly going to the menu to get the achievement.

**God or Devil? (cont'd)**: To access the seat of the Shadowseer, you will need to light all corners of each floor with Black Orbs to proceed down to the next level, repeating for three levels. At that point, you can access the "unknown" floor, where the fight with the Shadowseer begins. It'll summon the three bosses of the Pharos Ascent and Phoenix one at a time. Once defeated, you'll then be able to kill the Shadowseer and finish this hunt.

**Fishy Dreams** (Hunts): Ixion can appear on any floor of the Pharos Subterra. If you arrive on a floor and no enemies are swarming you, Ixion will spawn in shortly thereafter.

**Show Off II (cont'd)**: After defeating the Shadowseer, there is a 25% chance that the rare game Vagrant Soul will appear in the center room of Pharos Subterra - Abyssal North. It is a dark element entite enemy. Once Vagrant Soul is defeated, go up to Umbra South's center room to find the rare game Luxollid, a holy entite.

**Vagrant Story** (Steal/Poach): One of the toughest Entite type enemies, Vagrant Soul will wipe even high level parties. I ended up waiting to steal the Hunter's Blade from it until near the end when prepping for Trial Mode because it's Darkra and Feara are tough to handle. I set up a gambit on the non-stealer to do the healing and use Hi-Ethers if their MP < 10%. With a team that can handle 4000+ HP of damage, and a healer maintaining them, this rare steal should come fairly quickly. You will need to kill Vagrant Soul for the next one.

**Subterranean Bow Theft** (Steal/Poach): Luxollid is the other toughest Entite type enemy, though slightly easier than Vagrant Soul. However, the setup for stealing the Sagittarius bow is the same.

**The Black Sorcerer** (Hunts): The Piscodaemon is found in Giruvegan - Gate of Fire, on the opposite side of the invisible bridge that leads to The Great Crystal Way Stone.

**Proof of the Hunt: Skull** (Trophy Game) *and* **Glimmering Crystal** (Steal/Poach): To get the trophy game Crystal Knight to appear in The Great Crystal - A Vikaari Kanbhru Ra, make a circle around to the Sagittarius Gate Stone and back. You do not have to flip the Sagittarius Gate Stone to make Crystal Knight appear. When you make the loop, the Crystal Knight will be waiting. Make sure to steal the Glimmering Robes from the Crystal Knight before killing it. Once the achievement unlocks, turn attack gambits back on and finish the job.

**Show Off II (cont'd)**: Larva Eater is a gargoyle type rare game that appears in The Great Crystal where Way Stones XIII and XIV are. It only appears after having killed 256 enemies within The Great Crystal without leaving. You do not have to chain that amount. Larva Eater can rarely drop Hunter's Blade F (needed for **Eating Larva**).

**Darkness Prevails** (Treasure): A Yagyu Darkblade can be found in The Great Crystal - Sirhru Jilaam Pratii'vaa. The chest has a 25% appearance rate but the zone exit is so close that it is very easy to rezone until the chest appears.

**Show Off II (cont'd)**: Evil Spirit is a ghost/lich type rare game that appears in The Great Crystal at locations where Forbidden spawn. It has a 5% chance of replacing one of the Forbidden that spawn in these zones. The zones are the ones surrounding the save crystal near where Ultima spawns as well as the zones that lead to Omega Mark XII. It has a chance to drop Dragon Whisker L (needed for **Whisker of the Evil Spirit**).

**Gaze of the Scorpion** (Treasure): The rare game Glaring Eye (spawns occasionally after killing Hecteyes in Henne Mines) can rarely drop a Scorpion Tail. Getting chain levels of Hecteyes is probably difficult to manage, given that they tend to be around Abysteel so I happened to get lucky and one dropped. RNG manipulation will probably be required if the rare drop isn't happening naturally.

**Monk's Training** (Milestones): Getting an average level of 75 across the party is something that should be done over the course of normal preparation for getting the party through the superbosses and Trial Mode.
- Henne Mines Phase 2 areas and beyond are great for experience points, especially when coupled with Embroidered Tippet. Pithead Junction C, in particular, is a fantastic spot for grinding Abysteel.
- The Great Crystal areas beyond the Scorpio gate has a decent quantity of Necrofiends that can spawn. Forbidden are also plentiful in the zones surrounding the save crystal near Ultima, though their status ailments can make using the Embroidered Tippet over a Ribbon a bit more risky (or use gambits to heal them if Ribbons aren't available anyway). Forbidden are even more plentiful on the route down to Omega Mark XII!

**Echoes of Glory** (Minigame): I discovered that you don't actually need to alternate to move forward. You can mash both buttons simultaneously to move in a straight line. With that knowledge, you can set up turbo macros in PCSX2 to assigned Circle and Cross to one or two buttons that press those buttons every frame and breeze through races 11 through 25 without issue.

**Reflecting on Glory** (Minigame): Race 34 was the first race that I lost using just straight up turbo inputs without adjusting my running path, losing to the little guy. I retried and was able to win so there is some randomness to this. Sometimes, the little guy doesn't even trip, which would mean that either you MUST try to block them by positioning yourself in front of them, or it is impossible to win races when that happens.

**Downstream Fished** (Minigame): Give the fishing rod you acquired in Balfonheim to Ruskel in Dalmasca Estersand - South Bank Village. You'll find them on a small section of pier to the left of the boat that takes you to North Bank Village. Once they have the rod, talk to Ruskel again to start fishing. You only have Downstream as a location initially. To unlock a new location, and this achievement, perform the fishing minigame five times perfectly (no input mistakes which gives you the bonus item found). You *do not* have to do it perfectly five times in a row. Inputs consist of a string of four face button inputs, sometimes with a D-pad direction. The buttons will travel from the left or right and you must enter those inputs before the opposite side of the screen is reached or pressing the wrong button. A perfect fishing run means doing the inputs successfully six times in a row in one run.

**Runeweaver** (Sky Pirate's Den): This is another Sky Pirate's Den achievement that DOES require going into the Clan Primer in the menu in order to unlock it. If you are getting close to having all spells in the game, check the Clan Primer to see if the achievement unlocks. An easy way to tell if you have all of them is to go into the Gambits menu, click on an action, then scroll through all of the spell tabs to see if there are any blank spots. That will help you to identify what type of magic is missing and possibly infer which spell remains. You can also check the lists to compare your gambit actions list against to see exactly which spell is missing.

**Whisker of the Evil Spirit** (Treasure): Getting the Dragon Whisker L to drop from an Evil Spirit can be tough, given that it is the rare drop. However, you can improve your chances by grinding along the path to Omega Mark XII. Tons of Forbidden appear along this path and increase the possibility of Evil Spirit showing up. An added bonus: you can quickly build up chain levels on all of the Forbidden to improve the odds when breaking the chain on Evil Spirit. While Evil Spirit will show up more frequently, if your chain level isn't maxed out by the time it shows, it's not the end of the world. This is perfect to combine with raising levels for **Monk's Training**.

**Unpurified Race Runner** (Minigame): At race 70, Rikken was getting consistently getting just ahead of me when just straight turbo running with the frame limit removed. At this point, I had to run the races at normal speed and adjust myself to cut the corners to be able to consistently win. There are still moments that the little dude will sprint out ahead. It seems like if you bump into them on the second leg that they tend to fall over. I was still able to use turbo button mashes, but quickly release one button or another to make fine adjustments to be able to cut the corners readily. The last ten races have the other racers a bit faster, but keeping consistent on the cornering is still enough to stay ahead.

**Radiant Savior** (Superbosses): After defeating the Hell Wyrm, make sure to go into the Clan Primer to unlock this achievement.

**Proof of the Hunt: Slimy** (Trophy Game): Melt is a flan type trophy game found in Henne Mines - Pithead Junction B. Instead of many flan falling from the ceiling pressing the Gate Switchboard button, a giant Hecteyes could fall instead. That is Melt.

**Show Off II (cont'd)**: Vishno is a brainpan type rare game that appears in Pharos First Ascent - Wellspring Ravel 4th Flight, close to the stairs leading up to Horizon's Break. It only appears if you have killed at least 10 Deidars. You may need to double back to get enough Deidars to appear.

**Proof of the Hunt: Vile** (Trophy Game): Avenger is yet another headless humanoid trophy game found in Pharos Second Ascent - Station of Ascension, close to the stairs leading up to Reach of the Damned. The floor indicator near the minimap will say Floor 63.

**Show Off II (cont'd)**: Bombshell is can be found at Lhusu Mines - Lasche Span. It has a 20% spawn chance and can appear near either entrance to the zone.

**Show Off II (cont'd)**: Imdugud is a zu type rare game found where you fought "Belito", a.k.a. Ba'Gamnan II, in Nam-Yensa Sandsea - Withering Shores. Grab the chest containing a Turtleshell Choker that appears in the center of the platform and stand where the chest was. Imdugud should appear shortly thereafter. It if doesn't appear within 10 seconds, make sure you are right in the center of the platform.

**Great Crystal Debugging** (Superbosses): Omega Mark XII can be found in The Great Crystal via a chain of Way Stones. It is only active once the Yiazmat hunt is accepted. Prepare with the usual buffs but also make use of Wither to reduce Omega's ridiculous attack power while the other party members keep the HP up. Once a Wither lands, the rest of the battle will become much more manageable. Keep laying on Wither while healing until people stop dying then switch to attacking. Eventually, Omega will Berserk whoever is doing the primary healing. Use Dispel to remove it and keep going. Once defeated, pick up the Omega Badge loot that drops. That's one part for the final Bazaar good: the Wyrmhero Blade. DO NOT miss grabbing it!!

**GilgaFish** (Minigame): To be able to progress to the final locations of the fishing minigame, there is a puzzle to be solved. In order to start the puzzle, you must have defeated Gilgamesh. Once done, you can start to get colored bottles while fishing. The bottles themselves have self-contained puzzles that relate to locations to search. You'll know you have found the correct location when you see a Faint Glow to interact with. The Faint Glow will not be at the location unless you have the associated color bottle. Touching the Faint Glow will get you an item and a piece of the final puzzle. Find all five messages to put together a final location to go to.
- Blue bottle:
  - Hint: Shift each letter by one to find the place.
  - Answer: An adrift boat in Nabreus Deadlands - Echoes of the Past.
- Black bottle:
  - Hint: Letters = Numbers
  - Answer: Rats in Garamsythe Waterway - Central Waterway Control lead you to the location.
- Green bottle:
  - Hint: Skip a letter, then repeat in reverse.
  - Answer: An abandoned hut in Salikawood - Piebald Path, hidden in the overgrowth.
- Red bottle:
  - Hint: Two words; one large, one small; jumbled among the peaks and valleys.
  - Answer: In Mosphoran Highwaste - Babbling Vale, there is one shrine that is not active in the northwest corner of the zone. You'll find the glow where you would operate any active shrine within the quiet shrine.
- Yellow bottle:
  - Hint: Brave moogles maintain these; ask them to start and stop.
  - Answer: The Cerobi Steppe has 10 windmills around the area. Approaching them will reveal their number, with number 1 being found closest to Balfonheim and then looping around to number 10 in The Northsward. Turn on the numbers listed in the note while turning off those not in the note. Some may already be in the correct position.
- Final location:
  - Hint: A old poem reveals the order; put the phrase together in order, then the letter to follow.
  - Answer: The elder of South Bank Village reveals a poem about River, Forest, Ash, Darkness, and Fire. The poem reveals the order. The four letter "words" are then placed next to each other in that order. Finally, the lone letters are placed next to each other in that same order. It makes the following phrase: underground bridge to nowhere (the "r" of nowhere is missing in the clue...). The location then is Barheim Passage. Go into the center north entrance of Zeviah Span from West Annex and approach the large rubble that makes this a dead end. Gilgamesh will appear and give you the Matamune fishing rod.

**Midstream Fished** (Minigame): Complete five perfect fishing outings to unlock the next location. The midstream fishing commands can be four or five inputs, adds the use of shoulder buttons, and commands can move vertically. It's a lot more to take in than the downstream location. Fortunately, as you keep at it, you'll start to notice that there are only so many commands that the game will use, relating to the type of fish being caught. Get familiar with the inputs that will show up and you'll get this. Note that getting the Matamune does NOT make the minigame any easier, it only allows accessing later locations.

**Cactoid's Compact** (Minigame): Complete five perfect fishing outings in the upstream location AND have found the Cactoid's Compact key item. Cactoid's Compact appears as one of the perfect fishing rewards 10% of the time (if you have the Matamune) so you will more than likely have to have more perfect fishing results than the minimum. The upstream difficulty is similar to midstream but adds some new combinations that involve more shoulder buttons.

**Sword in the Crystal** (Treasure): As you approach the top of The Great Crystal, where Ultima resides, you'll see a treasure crystal in the center of the zone. After Ultima's entrance, you can grab the chest during the fight to get the achievement. Of course, it's probably not worth grabbing until after finishing the battle (and stealing the megalixir for the **High Seraph** achievement).

**High Seraph** (Steal/Poach): Ultima has, unfortunately, items in all three steal slots. This means that you are more likely to get the common and uncommon steal than the rare, i.e. the megalixir that we want. This means that we will want to manipulate the RNG prior to the fight. Thankfully, you can enter Ultima's chamber without triggering the fight and set up the RNG to the correct position prior to proceeding up to the arena to start the fight.
- In game, have only one character in your party with access to Steal and Cure, preferably without Brawler as well. Fran will always meet these requirements, no matter what job is assigned to her (except Brawler). I'll write these directions assuming Fran was chosen as the solo character.
- Remove her weapon and equip armor that will prevent her taking damage when attacking herself. Equip Thief's Cuffs on her (not required, but provides more RNG positions to work with).
- Have no buffs applied. No negative status effects either (though if you used the save crystal, that shouldn't be a problem).
- Go into Ultima's zone and stand near the arena, but don't go in yet.
- Open up the Status page for Fran.
- Start up the RNG Helper. Select "File", then "Steal". Enter Fran's level and magic power into the Character Stats section of the Helper. If Fran has the Serenity augment unlocked in her license board, check the box. Select the Cure spell from the list. In theory, you could use other cure type spells in the drop down but I've heard that the Helper can have issues with that...
- Cast Cure on yourself. Record the value displayed in the Last heal text box. Press the Start button.
- Cast Cure more. Update the value in Last heal and press Continue. Repeat until you no longer have to manually update the Last heal text box as the Helper has now found your RNG position.
- With the RNG position tracking, look at the number of positions displayed under Thief's Cuffs Advance for Rare (located above the Continue button). If you have a lot of positions to go (over 10), attack yourself. Press the Consume button to advance 10 positions (this is the number in the Consume text box). If you have less than 10 positions remaining, use Cure to advance RNG slowly.
- What if Fran is too slow and you need to cast Haste or use a Hastega Mote? Applying Haste advances RNG two positions. Use that to help know how far away from Thief's Cuffs reaching the rare steal position to cast Haste ahead of time.
- Once you have zero positions remaining and your gambits are all set for stealing right away, head into the arena, skip the cutscene, and let Fran steal. If you see that a megalixir was stolen (you can see two or more items stolen, so pay close attention), bring in your remaining characters and fight Ultima!
- If you stole the megalixir and win the fight, the achievement should then unlock! Congrats!

**Fell Angel** (Sky Pirate's Den): After defeating Ultima, make absolutely certain that you look in the Clan Primer ASAP to unlock this achievement!!!

**Full Invisible Protection** (Treasure): Okay, so I'm finding that the RNG Helper application has some issues with how it identifies that a chest is going to appear or not. I'm assuming that is because of running the game on emulator instead of an actual PS2. I found that entering and reentering the zone will spawn a chest with 295 gil after 17 entries. This reveals that the chest appearance is on position 532 rather than 530, like the app is telling me. As a point of reference, the starting RNG position for me on a fresh boot up is 467 (fast CDVD off) or 441 (fast CDVD on). Zoning into Ultima's chamber consumes 3 RNG positions for me so I need to enter after consuming RNG position 529 so the chest appears. However, once the chest appeared, the RNG Helper was accurate about the contents of the chest. So, I used Cure to verify that 3 positions were consumed. I then had no room to attack so I cast Cure until the next position would have Item 2 in the contents for the chest. I then opened the chest and got the Gendarme. This is also one of the four pieces of the new Zodiac equipment for the **Zodiac's Hidden Gifts** achievement.
- I *highly* recommend grabbing at least three of them. This will make some later challenges much easier, especially the Larva Eater grind and Trial Mode's final trial.

**Euclid's Measured Steppes** (Treasure): In Cerobi Steppe - Crossfield, chest 77 has the rare chance to have Euclid's Sextant. Clear out the zone of all enemies first, ensuring they are no longer respawning and advancing RNG. Moving into the Crossfield zone would consume about 20 positions in RNG helper, but that wasn't consistent, making getting the chest to spawn a difficult task. Once spawned however (or if it is already there), consuming RNG to get the required treasure is the same as before: advance RNG with punches and Cure until Item 2 is the next position, then open the chest and receive your reward.

**Break Some Bones** (Treasure): In Cerobi Steppe - Feddik River, chest 46 has the rare chance of having the Cudgel, one of the secret Zodiac equipment for **Zodiac's Hidden Gifts** (though this one isn't invisible). Once you have the chest spawned, clear the zone of enemies and then use your RNG manipulation method of choice to get the new weapon!

**Gotta Have Faith, Faith, Faith** (Treasure): In Cerobi Steppe - The Terraced Bank, chest 32 has the rare chance of giving a Rod of Faith. The chest is located behind Windmill 4, if entering from North Liavell Hills. Once the chest has spawned, clear the zone of enemies and manipulate RNG to get the weapon. One thing to note: in all of these Cerobi Steppe treasure achievements, I found that just rezoning to get the chest to appear was MUCH more reliable than trying to use the RNG Helper. The variance of zoning affecting RNG position made it difficult to work with. Using the RNG Helper makes more sense when you are working with areas without enemies that you need to clear out and tons of chests that consume positions to determine if they should spawn or not.

**Ramuh's Gift** (Treasure): In Cerobi Steppe - Old Elanise Road, chest 88 contains the Staff of the Magi. As before, once the chest is spawned, clear out the riff raff and manipulate your way to an achievement. Also, I did get the Staff of the Magi that was in The Great Crystal, but I didn't notice until doing this batch of RNG treasure cleanup that this achievement didn't unlock with that one, despite the fact that the achievement doesn't specify that you have to get the one in Cerobi Steppe... Another thing to note is that there is a string of traps in front of the southern entrance to the zone. The second trap from the left appears to always be a rejuvenation "trap" so it is safe to walk over it.

**Hidden Tower Tango** (Treasure): A chest containing the invisible sword Trango Tower can be found in Pharos Subterra - Abyssal South, in the central room containing two dragon lich and a magick pot.  The chest has a 2% spawn rate and will appear in the southeast corner, near a column against the wall. I initially tried to use the RNG Helper to spawn the chest again and had no success at all, despite clearing the enemies in the central room and the adjacent space. This resulted in a lot of frustrating, which I am starting to feel about this set in general with the RNG stuff. I eventually decided to stick to zoning to spawn the chest, which eventually did spawn. Once that happened, RNG Helper did the rest to identify when the Trango Tower would be in the chest. Since this is the last of the four new Zodiac equipment, I also unlocked **Zodiac's Hidden Gifts** at the same time.

**Cactoids Commendation** (Minigame): The hidden shoals fishing location isn't much more difficult than the previous two difficulty levels, adding some new commands for the Nebra succulent type fish but using a lot of those seen in the upstream area. In order to progress to the final area, you must fish up the Cactoid Commendation after completing a perfect fishing run, which has a 10% chance of showing up, and that's it. No needing a certain number of perfect fishing runs. If you get it on your first try, lucky you!

**True River Lord** (Minigame): The final location, Den of the River Lord, has only one fish to catch initially. The King of the Nebra has to be caught nine times in order to get Lu Shang's Badge. Since it is initially the only fish to catch, there is only one command to input: R1, L2, Square, Up, R2, L1, Right, Cross. If you memorize the input, you can start entering the command as soon as it appears on screen since it'll be the same every time. If you are having difficulty, keep at it. Also, when the fish swims horizontally, the increased amount of time will help you get the input down. Unfortunately, you can also end up getting empty bottles as well, which means that the King of the Nebra loses no lives for that successful input.

**Keeper of Precepts** (Steal/Poach): With my levels buffed up into the 90s and all areas explored with the exception of Zodiark's room, it was time to finally tackle this final esper. To prepare for stealing, the comments of this achievement provided some good insights. I followed the strategy provided by [RestlessTome](https://retroachievements.org/user/RestlessTome).
- After making my way to the entrance of Zodiark's arena, I started preparing my RNG manipulation, using Fran with no weapon, wearing the Thief's Cuffs, turning off gambits, and casting Cure. Once I had my position, I put myself into three positions away from acquiring the rare steal with the Thief's Cuffs. I also prepared Vaan with the Thief's Cuffs and gambits off.
- I entered the zone, skipped the cutscene, then issued the Steal command. Zodiark casts Darkja, killing Fran. Once prompted, I put Vaan into the party, issued the Steal command again, and got the Trango Tower. I then restored my party right away, reviving Fran, bringing in the third character, and turning on gambits to start the battle proper.
- Once Zodiark was defeated, I got the achievement! Now, OPEN THE SKY PIRATE'S DEN!!!

**High Summoner** (Sky Pirate's Den): With the final summon obtained, the Belias statue is unlocked, along with this achievement, once opening the Clan Primer.

**Zodiac Knight** (Sky Pirate's Den): With Zodiark obtained, this achievement is unlocked upon opening the Clan Primer.

**Cartographer** (Sky Pirate's Den): If this was your final location on the map (remember that one-time dungeons, to include Sky Fortress Bahamut, do not factor toward this), then opening the Clan Primer will unlock this achievement.
- This one is particularly dangerous in missing, since there is no notification that you have reached all areas in the game. Make absolutely certain that, as you get close to entering all zones, that you keep track of what is left and occasionally checking the Clan Primer.
- Also, consider making multiple save slots near the end so that you don't lose too much progress if you do happen to miss this and load a save with it already unlocked.

**Zodiac's Gift (cont'd)**: After defeating Zodiark, I could use it's base of operations for manipulating RNG to spawn the chest. You must have acquired all other one-time chests in the Special Charter Shaft before using this manipulation since their spawning consumes unpredictable RNG positions.
- With those requirements met, enter Zodiark's arena from the back side. Remove all but one character that can cast Cure. Unequip weapons and have armor/accessories that don't add status effects.
- In the RNG Helper, update the character's level, magic power, and if they have Serenity. For chest data, appear chance is 1%, RNG position is 8, and gil chance is 0%. No other boxes matter.
- Cure to find your current RNG position. Once you know how far away you are from Advance to Appear reaching 0, attack or Cure yourself until then. Once it hits 0, enter the Special Charter Shaft zone.
- Bring in your other party members, if needed, and reequip your previously solo character. Make your way to the stairs where the chest should now be. Open it for the Zodiac Spear and achievement. Note that the Diamond Armlet is not required as all slots have the weapon.

**Shield of the Wroth God** (Treasure): In Sochen Cave Palace, make your way back to the Hell Wyrm's chamber. Ensure the enemies near the door are killed and no others are around (you don't have to eliminate all of them in the zone, just near the door and on the way to it). As with other RNG manipulations, go to one character, unequip weapons and armor/accessories that provide status effects. For the chest data, appear chance is 1%, RNG position is 1, and gil chance is 0%. No other boxes matter. Cast Cure to find your current RNG position and ensure that it is consistently advancing under your control, then bring the Advance to Appear to 0 and open the door to the Hell Wyrm's arena. Walk toward the north end of the room where the chest should have spawned and it will be there as you get close.

**Frozen Glacier Seed** (Treasure): In Paramina Rift - Karydine Glacier is another 1% spawn chance treasure containing a Baltoro's Seed in all slots with 0% gil chance. I had success with using RNG position 2 for the chest to appear.

**Big Game Hunter II** (Bestiary): If you are like me and Yiazmat is your final entry, this achievement will unlock as soon as you target it or vice versa. You still need to defeat the final enemy to have it actually added to the Bestiary so that you can get Ba'Gamnan's statue added to the Sky Pirate's Den.

**Hunter Extraordinaire** (Steal/Poach): To get the Bone of Byblos from Yiazmat, you will need to set RNG position to 16 in the Advance for Rare (thanks to [jpc241](https://retroachievements.org/user/jpc421) for this detail) while IN Ridorana Cataract - Colosseum, but before approaching Yiazmat to start the fight. This is because after the cutscene plays for the start of the fight, RNG is advanced by that much as it basically reloads the zone (and all the chests and traps).
- Once you have your RNG position set up, and before advancing toward Yiazmat, bring in a second character who will actually do the stealing. Equip them with the Thief's Cuffs and turn off gambits on both characters.
- Advance toward Yiazmat, watch or skip the cutscene, then let Yiazmat target the party leader, the one not stealing. Once you see the aggro line, tell the second character to steal and pull back the party leader to avoid taking damage. If done properly (no one was attacked or attacking), the steal will be the Bone of Byblos!
- With the weapon stolen, now defeat Yiazmat! The key to this fight: the Break technicks. Set up gambits that apply Wither and Addle first. This will reduce the damage that Yiazmat can dole out and increase your immediate survivability. Let those statuses stack on Yiazmat until you no longer see success messages. Now switch to applying the other two Break technicks: Shear and Expose. Once complete, have all characters keep maintaining buffs, attacking, and reviving (especially once Yiazmat starts using Death Strike regularly). At 20% HP, Yiazmat will put up Reflect on the party. Dispel it, restore buffs and heal as needed, then finish up!

**Scrivener** (Sky Pirate's Den): With the felling of your final enemy and placing their entry in the Bestiary, the Ba'Gamnan statue is unlocked. Open up the Clan Primer to get the achievement.
- **NOTE**: The other achievements for the bestiary (**Hunter of Monsters**, **Big Game Hunter**, and **Show Off**) are triggered on interacting with a monster, NOT for actually adding the entry to the bestiary. You MUST kill a monster to add it to the bestiary proper which is what actually unlocks **Scrivener**.

**Order of Ambrosia** (Sky Pirate's Den): Having the final statue in the Sky Pirate's Den will also unlock this achievement at the same time. Congrats on the "platinum" status!

**Farewell to a Legend** (Hunts): Return to Montblanc to inform him of your victory. Upon receiving your reward, you'll unlock this achievement. Congrats!

**Dragon Crest** and **Master Deal Hunter** (Bazaar): With the receipt of your reward for defeating Yiazmat, you now have the items needed to make the Wyrmhero Blade. Sell the Omega Badge, Godslayer's Badge, and Lu Shang's Badge to unlock the sword, then buy it to get the last bazaar good, completing both achievements!

**Mist Master** (Characters?): This was rough... Getting the Mist Charges to line up while also having more quickenings to unleash was very much a luck of the draw. Too late, I saw a great strategy proposed by [SayuriMio](https://retroachievements.org/user/SayuriMio): have three characters with only level 1 quickenings and give them the level 3 espers. This means that they only have 1 quickening to appear in the roulette but have 3 charges to work with. Then, while using the quickenings, focus on one character until all of their charges run out. If a Mist Charge option ever shows up, use it. Keep rotating through quickenings and building up the chain. You'll still have to contend with hoping that a Mist Charge shows up, but this gives you much more flexibility to make that happen.
- The level 3 espers are Famfrit, Chaos, Ultima, and Zodiark.

**Tsunami Bomb** and other esper ultimate attack achievements (Espers): I never really use espers other than the one time that it was needed for the achievement so I'm knocking them out now, finally. Just summon one of your espers, take control of them, and then select the last option in the esper's Technicks menu.

**Eating Larva** (Treasure): While there are a couple of methods out there to improve your chances of getting Larva Eater to drop the Hunter's Blade F, chaining Gargoyle Barons and then using Mom Bombs for building the kill count without breaking the chain is arguably the most convenient.
- The setup: Chain Gargoyle Barons in Giruvegan. The best spot is Gate of Fire where there are plenty of Gargoyle Barons and only a few Vivian. Manually target the Gargoyle Barons and avoid picking up their loot to increase chain levels quicker. If you run out of them, travel back two zones to The Aadha Water-Steps and return to respawn them. On average, I can reach max chain at around 22-26 kills, with only having to leave Gate of Fire once to restock on Gargoyle Barons. Once at max chain level, head into The Great Crystal. Reach Way Stone XX.
- The Loop: Have two characters gambits set up for healing duty. The party leader should have gambits set up for casting Toxify. If you happen to have grabbed at least three Gendarme from Ultima's chamber, healing will probably not even be necessary since it'll block most attacks AND absorb elemental damage. Toxify will poison the Mom Bombs, potentially getting them to self destruct or die from the poison while not breaking the chain. The loop is a run around the three zones south of Way Stone XX killing the Mom Bombs with this setup, accruing the kills needed to spawn Larva Eater. Toxifying Mom Bombs for the 255 kills to spawn Larva Eater requires 17 laps (255 kills with 15 Mom Bombs per lap). The main danger of this loop is that Reapers can potentially spawn at the Way Stone. Avoid them at all cost and continue the loop.
  - A riskier strategy (that can break your chain if you aren't careful) but can help speed things up is to have your Toxify character also cast Bio to do some damage and inflict Sap. Use a gambit that only casts Bio if a foe has 100% HP and then set Toxify to be used if a foe has Sap status. This is risky because if Bio is cast too many times, you'll inadvertently kill a Mom Bomb yourself and end the chain. So, the ideal way to do this is to draw the aggro of all five Mom Bombs in a zone by running in while holding R2 and then when they are all together, let go of R2 and let the gambits do the work. This avoids the risk of casting Bio too many times if Mom Bombs are scattered around and not blowing up right away.
  - Something that I noticed was that when Reapers show up, if I change the direction of my loop, the Reapers go away. On my winning run that finally netted the Hunter's Blade F, I would swap directions every 5 laps. I never saw Reapers at the Way Stone. I'd love more conclusive evidence that this works but I only realized that this was happening when I was on my final attempt so I don't have enough data.
- The Larva Eater: Once the Larva Eater has spawned at the Way Stone, kill it traditionally. It will continue the chain (it's the same type as the Gargoyle Barons) which means that the chance of it dropping the weapon is increased. If Reapers are in the zone as well as the Larva Eater, use a ranged weapon or single target spell to get Larva Eater's attention without drawing the Reapers' aggro.
  - In the interest of further automation without having to update gambits whenever the Larva Eater shows up, I set my attack gambits on all three characters to target only ice weak foes. Larva Eater is weak to ice while Mom Bombs are weak to water and Reapers are weak to holy.
- Didn't get the weapon? Continue to make the loop. Once you have spawned Larva Eater the first time, it will respawn after a potentially smaller number of kills if you don't leave The Great Crystal, between 30 and 255 kills. So, if you are lucky, it'll take less laps for Larva Eater to show up again. Given the amount of luck for this, expect considerable time to complete this. It might be best to do this after completing the game and a lot of the set, since having higher levels and better gear will make this grind much quicker and easier. It took me about 15 kills of the Larva Eater to get the weapon to finally drop. Dig in and hope that RNG is blessing you in your attempts!

**Magick Seed** (Steal/Poach): An excellent spot to set up RNG manipulation and steal a Baltoro's Seed from a magick pot is in Pharos Subterra - Penumbra North. There is a lone magick pot in the rooms after the Phoenix boss chamber. Go into the zone that the magick pot is alone, set up the RNG position so that the next steal is a rare steal, then steal! Easy! Run out to the boss chamber and then if you want to steal another Baltoro's Seed (or more), head one more zone away, go back and repeat! Having a stock of Baltoro's Seeds is a good idea for Trial Mode...

**Renewing the Night** (Treasure): Nightwalker is the monster that gives up the Renewing Morion as a rare drop in Pharos Subterra. Unfortunately, they only appear if you wait for 7 minutes in a room with a Pedestal of Night. To improve the odds of getting the drop, building chain levels on a similar monster would be ideal. To do so, [Sonicshadowsilver2](https://retroachievements.org/user/Sonicshadowsilver2) suggests the following:
- Head to Dalmasca Westersand. Get Dustia to appear in Corridor of Sand by having a character with less than 10% HP. Kill it and run out of the zone before the experience and LP are displayed (zone out glitch). This raises the chain without despawning Dustia.
  - If you do inadvertently cause Dustia to be killed and it won't respawn, you'll need to leave Dalmasca Westersand to Ogir-Yensa Sandsea and come back to continue. Going into Rabanastre will end the chain.
- Raise chain until you max chain level. Since you aren't picking up loot bags, you should hit max chain level in 25 kills. Now you can head back to The Pharos. Unfortunately, teleport save crystals are not available for this as this would kill the chain. Take the Strahl instead! Head to the Western Divide without killing any monsters and board the airship, heading for Ridorana Cataract.
- Run through Ridorana and enter The Pharos. Take the elevator down to the Penumbra level. Head directly for the northwest room. Again, no killing any monsters. I turned off gambits to ensure that I wasn't attacking rather than updating gambits to turn off attack gambits. Holding R2 could also work for this.
- While near the Pedestal of Night, wait for seven minutes. Turn attack gambits back on. Use emulator fast forward to pass the time. Once Nightwalker appears, it'll die and drop a high level loot bag. If you are lucky, you'll get it on your first attempt. Good luck!!
  - It took me 12 Nightwalkers to get the Renewing Morion. Since this is a rare drop (18%), not a very rare (7%), I was probably on the unlucky side for this one.
- To fight Nightwalker again, turn off gambits and run to the elevator. You can return directly to the spawn point again (I tested that Nightwalker does appear without leaving The Pharos), I recommend stepping out of The Pharos so that it resets the Penumbra Interior monsters. Otherwise, you'll have a gathering waiting for you as you step off the elevator.

**Grand Towering Helm** (Treasure): Tower is a golem that vary rarely drops a Grand Helm. As with Nightwalker, building up a chain to improve the odds prior to fighting Tower is a great idea. To do so, go to Mosphoran Highwaste and build max chain level on Clay Golems just outside of Babbling Vale. To bring that chain level to The Pharos, we can't use the Strahl's anchor point in Babbling Vale or the chain will reset. So, use the chocobo nearby to run through the rest of the Highwaste to Salikawood and then Phon Coast. Use the Strahl anchor there to get to Ridorana Cataract and then The Pharos!
- Tower appears near the end of the Third Ascent. Ensure that your attack gambits are off and use the shortcuts through the First and Second Ascent to get to Third Ascent quickly. To get to Tower, take the black way stone, then green, red, and the color for your sacrifice (pink for mini-map, for example). Now head to the colorless way stone, turn on gambits, and hope for Tower!
- If Tower is not at the other end of the colorless way stone, simply warp back and forth with the colorless way stones until it shows up. It has a 20% chance to show, so it may take a few tries. Didn't get the Grand Helm? To get Tower to respawn again, you will need to travel through all of the colored way stones again. I had success with it showing up via the hidden path way stones as well, though you'll have to deal with traps rather than longer distance and a ton of enemies. You make the call.

**Deadly Renewal Walk** (Steal/Poach): For poaching when at high levels, the best thing is to have gambits set up to use Sight Unseeing on a blind character targeting a foe nearby then Poach when an enemy is in HP Critical status. It can be the same character or different characters. While grinding for these rare poaches, you'll want any attack gambits off other than these and then manually attack with the non-blind characters on monsters that are not the targets for poaching.
- The Ring of Renewal is a rare (5% chance) poach from the Deadly Nightshades in The Feywood - Walk of Flitting Rifts. There are a lot of them around by the northern zone exit to Golmore Jungle so it shouldn't take too long to get your accessory from them.

**Branchway Cannon** (Steal/Poach): You can poach a Ras Algathi from the rare game Phyllo (5% chance to get it) in Golmore Jungle - The Branchway. Phyllo only has a 20% chance of spawning in two locations in the zone, so this may take a bit of time to get the weapon and achievement.

**Perfect Protection** (Treasure): One of the major treasure challenges of the game! To get a Ribbon at the Ozmone Plain, you need to spawn a Lv. 99 Red Chocobo and defeat it. This chocobo appears in the Haulo Green zone, having only a 1-in-256 chance of replacing one of the other chocobos that spawn here after having killed all six chocobos in the zone at least once. That is some _very_ low odds... There has got to be a better way to increase the efficiency of getting this super rare spawn to happen without having to move two zones away. Fortunately there is a way!
- I recommend being at a high level at this point so that you don't have to worry about the killing portion of this, just the grind. Have a character that can cast Break. Ensure that you have nothing equipped that will perform a counterattack (especially Genji equipment... that messed me up a couple of times).
- After leaving Jahara, kill all six chocobos in Haulo Green. Head out two zones away and return.
- Head to the pack of three chocobos on the east side of the zone first. Turn off all gambits except for casting Break on a foe (nearest visible or any is fine). Approach the pack of three so that you can pick from all of them in a list when you choose Attack in the menu. You should see something like this in the Attack menu, as an example:
  - Black Chocobo B
  - Red Chocobo A
  - Black Chocobo A
- The chocobos in the first two slots should be killed with regular attacks (in our example: Black Chocobo B and Red Chocobo A). Cast Break on the chocobo in the third slot (in our example: Black Chocobo A).
  - This is because the Lv. 99 Red Chocobo will only spawn in this third slot of the packs of three chocobos.
- Once the chocobo in the third slot has turned to stone, head to the other three pack of chocobos on the west side of the zone. Repeat the same process.
- Feel free to kill the Vipers that spawn in as you walk between the chocobo packs. I highly recommend manual targeting rather than any sort of gambit.
- Since these two particular chocobos were turned to stone, they aren't considered "killed" and thus they will continuously respawn while you remain in the zone. Simply walk back and forth between the two chocobos as they respawn and continue to petrify them over and over.
- Expect this to take a long time, even with fast forward in-game and with the emulator.
  - It took me about an hour with both fast forwards going and petrifying hundreds of chocobos...
- Once the Lv. 99 Red Chocobo appears, kill it and pick up it's drop for the Ribbon and the achievement.
  - I won't go into the details of fighting it here. If your level is sufficiently high enough with high rank gear at this point, you should have no trouble with this fight. Post game grinding should get you there effortlessly.

**Tales From the Crypt** (Treasure): This is arguably the toughest treasure drop achievement of the set. Crypt Bunny has a rare chance of dropping the Muramasa. It is also a rare game with a spawn requirement that can take considerable time and ruin chain levels: killing all Tartarus and at least six Cerberus in The Feywood - Walk of Stolen Truths. So the puzzle is to somehow build chain levels and maintain it while eliminating the required monsters in the zone. Thankfully, RA user [LeoHighwind](https://retroachievements.org/user/LeoHighwind) has an excellent strategy for the puzzle itself:
- Chain rabbit type fiends somewhere else to raise the chain level. The closest reliable spot is two Mus that spawn near the entrance to Henne Mines in the Walk of Dancing Shadow zone. If you don't see the Mus there, enter the mines and return and you'll find one to the south and the other northeast. Loop around to get two zone changes through Walk of Stolen Truths and Antiquity's End (don't use the save crystal!) and keep killing Mu while not picking up their loot. You'll reach max chain level by 25 kills.
- With max chain level, set up gambits as follows:
  - Ensure attack gambits are off! No counterattack equipment!!
  - One person has two gambits using 1000 Needles with a foe greater than or equal to 70% HP and greater than or equal to 30% HP.
  - Another person has one gambit with 1000 Needles with a foe greater than or equal to 50% HP. If you don't have two characters with 1000 Needles, have only one character with the foe greater than or equal to 30% HP. This will certainly be slower, but it will still work.
  - A character has a gambit with Poison (NOT Toxify!) targeting a foe with less than 30% HP.
  - This will result in doing only 3000 HP of damage to the Cerberi and Tartaruses and then the Poison will do the rest, resulting in a kill that doesn't break the chain.
- Proceed into Walk of Stolen Truths and eliminate all of the Tartaruses and at least six Cerberi until the Crypt Bunny spawns. Avoid the Golems and Holy Elemental. Kill the Crypt Bunny and pray.
  - This is the part that makes this a real pain and drag. It takes a long time to even get the Crypt Bunny to appear, then you are praying for the 18% chance to drop the sword for the achievement. LeoHighwind reported that it took them THIRTY Crypt Bunnies... It took me four. Good luck with the hunt!

**Mine's Holy Dragon** (Steal/Poach): The Holy Lance is the rare poach from Gizamaluk, which can be found in Henne Mines - Phase 2 Shaft. The problem here is that there are swarms of Abysteel around three of the four Gizamaluk that appear here. Sight Unseeing/Poach doesn't work on Abysteel so you'll need to eliminate them with your other characters. Abysteel are weak to holy and Gizamaluk is not. Use that to your advantage! Put gambits on the other two characters to attack only holy-week foes while your poacher has their Sight Unseeing/Poach gambits. That'll make passing through Phase 2 Shaft to grind for the lance much quicker. This grind will be made much easier if you have access to Zodiark's arena to quickly pass through two zones to reset Phase 2 Shaft.

**Upland Doubling** (Steal/Poach): The easiest of the poaching achievements to do, given that there are TONS of coeurl all over Tchita Uplands. Set up your poaching gambits and walk around and you'll get this fairly quickly, despite this being a rare poach. Getting Embroidered Tippets is great too, since they'll help speed up your leveling for Trial Mode.
- ***TODO***: Should probably move this up earlier in the roadmap... Having early access to the accessory is a real boon.

**Sword of the Fog** (Treasure): Getting the Durandal, a very rare drop from the rare game Velelu, is similar to some of the other drop manipulations we've done. Use Banshees in Nabreus Deadlands - The Slumbermead to build up the chain level with a quick two zone location using the save spot zone, Succor Midst Sorrow. There are two Banshees that consistently spawn: in the water and reeds north of chest 19 (don't go too far south or you'll approach a Crusader and possibly break the chain), and in the water north of and between chests 21 and 22 (don't go too far west where the Emeralditan is). Use caution while grinding these two Banshees as there is a Foobar that will spawn east of chest 21. Once your chain level is maxed, head through the secret passage to The Fog Mutters with a character's health less than 20%. This leads to the main issue with this grind: Velelu only spawns once per visit to Nabreus Deadlands. You'll have to leave the whole area and return to try another attempt.
- Good news! Velelu is susceptible to the zone-out glitch as well! When you meet the requirements for it to spawn, approach the fiend and get it to chase you toward the zone exit. Head back in and try to get Velelu to get as close to the zone line as possible. Head in and out of the zone as necessary to avoid anything devastating. Once positioned properly, kill Velelu while running up against it so that you cross the zone line (hopefully) as the loot bag drops while also not accruing XP or LP. Now, reenter The Fog Mutters again and, as long as a party member is still below 20% HP, Velelu will respawn near the opposite zone exit. Repeat until you get the sword!
- Given that this is a 7% drop chance (assuming max chain level), expect this to take a good amount of time to get the Durandal.

**Hell Horse Armor** (Treasure): This is the primary example of using the zone out glitch. Without being able to build a chain before fighting Helvinek, because of having to kill Oversouls (and the enemies in the Necrohol to even get Oversouls to appear!), you can use the zone out glitch to get chain levels on Helvinek and continue to kill and get the loot until you get the Grand Armor. Since Helvinek won't be considered "killed" while using the glitch, the conditions for it to spawn will always be met as you enter a new zone. The chain levels should build up quickly!
- While attacking, position yourself closely to the zone exit line. Use the chain indication to know when you have made the kill to begin moving through the zone line. Once at max chain level, you now need to consider Helvinek's position to the zone line so that you can grab the loot as it dies and then get out of the zone. It may be best to have other character(s) do the fighting while the controlling character is pushing Helvinek into position.
- If there is any risk at all of not being able to pick up the loot before the XP and LP numbers appear, prioritize escaping the zone over the loot! Setting up another chance at Helvinek takes far longer than just letting it respawn and trying again.
- When Helvinek dies, you have approximately 1.5-2 seconds for it's death animation to show the XP/LP numbers. There is a small window to grab the loot and run to the zone exit so you don't have to get Helvinek right next to the exit.
- If a Dark Elemental shows up, you will want to zone away if you see Helvinek cue up any magic attacks. Dark Elemental getting aggressive could cause gambit attackers to break the chain. Be wary. It's not the end of the world if the chain breaks, so long as you maintain Helvinek spawning with the zone out glitch, but you will have to build the chain again.

**Waterway Stalker** (Steal/Poach): This can be accomplished when preparing for the fight with Cúchulainn. In Garamsythe Waterway, in either the No. 3 or 4 Cloaca Spur, a Gespenst, a reaper type monster, will appear in the drained areas if the side's sluice gates are shut. You can easily get it to spawn while in the upper paths and it will teleport near you. Steal and then run around two zones (easy to do in this area with the many zone exits) to respawn it with new items to steal. Even though it is a rare steal, this shouldn't take too long to do with how quickly you can respawn the fiend and try for the steal again.

**Knot a Problem** (Challenge): Hopefully, you have been making use of Knots of Rust to build up the damage of a Dark Matter throughout the game (or rebuilt it if you have used one at all and retained that use without reloading a save). Equip Thief's Cuffs before the final fight with The Undying so that you can improve your steal rate for getting the Dark Matter. Once the battle begins, maintain gambits only to steal and maintain health on the party (buffs don't matter so much since The Undying will just remove them). Once you have successfully stolen (the Dark Matter is all The Undying has), proceed with damaging the boss. You'll know that you have succeeded as well since the active challenge icon will appear once you have stolen the Dark Matter. Once it puts up Perfect Defense, you know that it has hit the 20% HP threshold. Wait out the paling and heal up/buff up for Teraflare. Once that is unleashed and the paling falls, throw the Dark Matter. As long as you maxed out the amount of damage that Dark Matter can do (60,000 HP), you should kill The Undying with the one Dark Matter at the 20% HP point (45,670 HP).
- If you want to make sure that your Dark Matter's output has been maxed out, or at least exceeds 46k of damage, make a save and throw one to see if it is enough. If you don't have one to test with, there is one in the chest right in front of you once on board the Bahamut. Use it on one of the endless enemies to see the damage, reset the game, then either continue using Knots of Rust or proceed to The Undying.

### Trial Mode

I am classifying all of the Trial Mode achievements separately from the main game roadmap since you cannot carry over anything from Trial Mode into the main game (I'm seeing something about saving every 10 stages... is that even in IZJS? Or just TZA?). Maybe it should have its own roadmap? Perhaps I can plot out a way to do the mode in one shot...

Seitengrat is allowed in everything but trials 95 and above. However, there is one achievement that requires completing the entire run of Trial Mode in one shot without Seitengrat. If you feel that your party is strong enough to complete the trials without Seitengrat at all, ensure that you have it unequipped prior to the start of your run.

Prepare for Trial Mode runs by setting up your characters in the main game. Put on the equipment they'll need, learn all licenses that you need (if you haven't already by the end of the postgame grind), have accessories on hand to swap to as needed for certain challenges (Ribbons, Thief's Cuffs, etc.). Stock up on items! Having ethers, hi-ethers, and elixirs will be beneficial. Since the non-Seitengrat invisible zodiac equipment isn't prohibited, I recommend making good use of them. I highly recommend getting a hold of enough Gendarme for the whole cast (or at least three of them).

You can save your game after every tenth trial. Note that these saves are only to resume your current Trial Mode session. DO NOT save over your game in progress!! The game warns you of this when you start Trial Mode, but not when you save. Saving is good for something however! Make a separate save for each leg of Trial Mode. This will allow you to pick up close to a spot where you may need to make multiple attempts to poach or steal for an achievement.

When going for a poach or steal from the rare game, make sure that you don't kill the main monster or group of monsters before spawning it. If there is a unique monster for the stage, killing that monster will advance you to the next stage without killing the rest, including rare game. 

Roadmap: Probably not needed since the achievements are given in order
- Trial 3 - Poach: Ripe Rampager (run past initial enemies and head left around the corner)
- Trial 8 - Poach: Imdugud (stand in middle of platform among Bagoly for 10-15 seconds, have equipment to reach the flying foe)
- Trial 9 - Poach: Cultsworn Lich (stand to left of chest on right side of room)
- Trial 12 - Steal: Melt (kill five Jelly then stand in front of gate switch for several seconds without moving)
- Trial 28 - Steal: Cubus (stand in one of the four corners)
  - Retain the save after Trial 30!
- Trial 31 - Poach: Apsara (head straight past several water puddles and get behind large dusk stone; has more than one poach item...)
  - Retain the save after Trial 40!
- Trial 43 - Poach: Pallicant (run to door in distance and return to start)
  - Retain the save after Trial 60!
- Trial 64 - Steal: Vorres (go to far side of room, near treasure chests)
- Trial 69 - Poach: Spee (go to far side of room, near treasure chests... but it seemed to show up when I went to the center of the room...)
- Trial 70 - Steal: Crypt Bunny (go to far side of room, near treasure chests; take out Krjn so she doesn't defeat the enemies before you steal; I stole Phoenix Down but it didn't unlock...)
  - Retain the save after Trial 70!
- Trial 72 - Steal: Overlord (this is the first one that requires stealing a specific item but has multiple steal slots filled, meaning RNG manipulation???)
  - Retain the save after Trial 80!
- Trial 82 - Steal: Crystal Knight (stand in center)
- Trial 87 - Steal: Hell Wyrm (second one that requires stealing specific item with multiple steal slots filled... should be RNG manipulatable)
- Trial 88 - Steal: Evil Spirit (kill a bunch of Forbidden without killing Disma)
- Trial 89 - Steal: Fafnir (third one to require specific steal, must also kill with a single item (Warp Mote, it seems?); Jegged says there is only one item to steal...)
- Trial 95 - Steal: Ultima (fourth one, though there are two chances)
- Trial 96 - Steal or Poach: Glaring Eye (kill Abysteel without killing them all and one will hopefully spawn; Jegged says only Poach...)
- Trial 97 - Steal: Zodiark (tied for the fourth one, as this is the other chance)
- Trial 100 - Steal: Judges (steal from all of them successful and win the fight)

**Trial of the Zodiac**: Active from starting Trial Mode at the title screen. You can continue from your save, as long as you started from the beginning of Trial 1 without stopping playing the game. An active challenge indicator will appear if you don't have Seitengrat equipped on any character.
- There are two separate reports on this achievement having issues unlocking when completing all of Trial Mode without dying. Specifically, it seems that potentially saving during the run could cause the active achievement to end prematurely. Unfortunately, the exact cause is unknown... If you happen to notice that this active achievement indicator disappears during your attempt at a 100 stage run, let me know! I'd love to get more data to be able to help the developer isolate the issue and make this achievement work better. If anyone is able to replicate this issue, definitely put in a ticket for the dev to be able to fix it.

Trial Mode progression achievements: Not much to say about these as they will be unlocked with the making your way through the 100 stages. There are no restrictions as with the other achievements though so if you are having a hard time with the Judges in Stage 100, feel free to use whatever means at your disposal to at least get **The Trial Ends!** achievement.

**Ripe for the Picking**: Ripe Rampager appears in Stage 3, if you run past the initial enemies, heading left to the rear of the room and then right around the corner. Set up your poaching gambits. Successfully poach the monster to get the achievement.

**Eight with Haste**: Imdugud appears in Stage 8. This is the same location where it appears in the normal game with the same spawn conditions (stand in the center of the platform). Do your poaching strategy when it arrives.

**Dying Dark Matter**: Cultsworn Lich appears soon after the last rare game in Stage 9. Head to the right side of the room near a chest to get it to spawn among the other Lich. Poach away when it arrives!

**Stuck in the Melt**: Melt appears in Stage 12. It has an oddly specific spawn requirement: kill 5 Jelly and then stand near the gate switch. Once it arrives, steal from it.

**Gleaming the Cubus**: Cubus appears in Stage 28. Several sources say to stand in one of the four corners and it will appear. The room is cross shaped. I tried standing in one end for a while and it wasn't appearing so I went to all four ends of the cross and it showed up. Steal from Cubus when it spawns.

**Passion of Christ**: This is the first of the Trial Mode challenges where RNG is a factor. Apsara appears in Stage 31. This is convenient since you can have a save spot retained for this stage! If you fail to get the Crown of Laurels when you poach Apsara, you can reload your save and try again. Since it is the rare poach item, it'll take a bit of time to get it. You can find Apsara spawn in behind the very large dusk stone in the room.

**Poachin Pals**: Another RNG dependent poach, this time from Pallicant in Stage 43. Pallicant will appear when you run past the Deathclaws to the far end of the room, then run back to the start.

**Friday the 64th**: Vorres appears in Stage 64. Run past the two Humbaba Mistant to the rear of the room and Vorres will appear. Steal from it to get the achievement.

**Bunny Cat**: Spee appears in Stage 69. Several sources stated that it appears when going to the opposite side of the room from the start, but it spawned when I went to the center of the room. Leave the Wild Malboro alone until Spee appears and you poach it. Again, this is a rare poach item, so you may need to run through Stages 61-68 a bunch of times in order to get this...

**Trials from the Crypt**: Crypt Bunny appears in Stage 70, so soon after the last one! Thankfully, all you have to do is steal successfully. Do note that the common steal item is a Phoenix Down. If you have 99 Phoenix Downs in your inventory, you will not get the achievement. So check your items before you attempt to steal once it spawns. You can find it near the chests on the opposite side of the arena. Make sure to not kill Carrot until you do the steal. Also, you are joined by an NPC named Krjn so you'll want to defeat her before spawning Crypt Bunny.

**HunterLord**: The Overlord appears in Stage 72. Since this is another RNG challenge, make sure to retain your Stage 71 save for repeated attempts at this. You need to get the rare steal from Overlord, which is a Hunter's Blade. The rare poach is the Hunter's Blade F, a very different weapon and does not count toward the achievement.

**Trials of the Crystal Skull**: The Crystal Knight appears in Stage 82. Don't kill all of the Reaver in the room or you'll end the stage. Go to the center of the room to spawn Crystal Knight, then successfully steal from it.

**Sword in the Wyrm**: The Hell Wyrm returns in Stage 87. This time, you need to get the rare steal Excalibur from it. RNG manipulation? Is that possible? Some bosses seem to wait until you approach, while others will move after a brief pause upon entering the stage. If RNG manipulation is possible, then this won't be too bad.
- There is discussion regarding if this is actually missable or not. I believe that it doesn't respawn in Trial Mode unless you start a new run. That doesn't make much sense though since old Trial Mode saves shouldn't be overwritten and you can't access prior stages. So I believe that this is inappropriately marked.
- RNG manipulation is a no go! Hell Wyrm will advance shortly after entering the stage... Boo!
- The important part here is that you must steal the Excalibur AND THEN defeat the Hell Wyrm. Make sure you watch the combat log closely when you steal! If you see Excalibur appear, don't reset! You'll have to then try stealing over and over again to get another steal...

**88 Bottles of Spirits**: Evil Spirit can appear in Stage 88. Just like in the normal game, it has a chance of appearing in place of Forbidden. Disma is also here and killing it is what ends the stage, so you need to leave Disma alone until Evil Spirit appears. Once it does, steal from it.

**Grand Demise**: Fafnir is the lone enemy in Stage 89. You may want to turn off gambits before ending the previous stage so you don't start attacking Fafnir right away, invalidating this achievement. This one is special because not only do you need to get the rare steal item, you must also kill Fafnir with one item. I found that using a Warp Mote will instantly kill Fafnir. This means that you MUST have one in your inventory either before starting Trial Mode or maybe you can find one in the treasure chests leading up to the Fafnir stage.
- Once you steal the Grand Helm, the active challenge icon will appear. Now kill Fafnir with the Warp Mote!
- Holy shit... Warp Motes can fucking MISS! So you actually want to have a stock of them built up! I had 9 on hand when I successfully stole. I had to use 5 of them to land the killing blow! When I was practicing to do the kill with one item, I had thought that the Warp Mote worked the first time every time I tried... That scared me!
- The fight takes place in a very small arena so you have no opportunity to set up RNG manipulation, as far as I can tell.
- Perhaps one of the treasure chests in Fafnir's arena has the item that kills it in one use?
  - Nope! The only attack item was Meteorite Type C and that doesn't do it.

**Lord of Lords**: You have two opportunities for this achievement. Ultima is on Stage 95 and Zodiark is on Stage 97. Both have the Lordly Robes as their rare steal. Ultima moves to attack the party shortly after entering the stage so there is no opportunity to set up RNG. I am unsure if Zodiark will begin attacking if you don't move from the start...
- Once you have successfully stolen it from either Ultima or Zodiark, the active challenge icon will be displayed. You must now defeat BOTH bosses to win the achievement. If you get it during Ultima, you need to survive through Zodiark. Good luck!

**Eye of Darkness**: A Glaring Eye can appear in Stage 96. The room is full of Abysteel which can spawn anywhere from 36-72 of them. Glaring Eye has a 1% chance of spawning after an Abysteel is killed. Supposedly, the Dark Matter can be obtained by stealing or poaching. Also, if you kill Abysteel too quickly, such as with area of effect attacks, you won't have as many Abysteel appear. So, as you kill them, make sure to walk around the room to get more to spawn and improve your chances at getting Glaring Eye to actually appear...
- I only had one character with attack gambits while the other two healed. I controlled one of the healers who was also prepped for stealing in case the Glaring Eye showed up. I would then walk the party leader around the room to try to get more Abysteel to spawn in the hopes that a Glaring Eye would show.

**FF12: Judgement Day**: Holy cow this is a beast! I was trying to steal from one judge at a time and then kill that one, moving on to the next one. It was about 10 minutes in that I realized that the other judges will throw elixirs on dying judges! I wasn't getting anywhere because the judge I was focusing on was getting fully healed back up. It was another 30 minutes or so of this when I thought of another strategy. I setup gambits to Wither all of the judges so that they don't deal as much damage while using Bubble with Curaja to keep health high and take the onslaught of damage. While the Wither is being used, one character with Thief's Cuffs went around to all of the judges, picking their pockets one at a time. If Wither was starting to get ineffective, I switched to Shear to reduce magic defense of the judges. Using Nihopalaoa with Remedy is also a great way to help keep control of the fight as all the judges have varied status weaknesses. Once every judge was stolen from, I went on the offensive, casting Dispelga to remove buffs and casting my biggest area of effect spells such as Scathe and Scourge (spells and motes). The first focus was Ghis, as he has the lowest HP and is the most annoying. If someone can't cast spells or use motes, I targeted Ghis with attacks. Once Ghis is dead, I focused on Drace to get rid of her buffing the other judges. Next was Bergan. While not as bad with the Wither applications, Bergan is effectively alone at this point and can be removed with just attacks. The last two, Gabranth and Zargabaath, both support each other trying to heal each other. Zargabaath can be put to sleep and then spells could be used to try to reduce the HP of both judges at once. Either way, Zargabaath has the least HP of the two and should be the primary target. Gabranth will be the toughest as his HP gets low. Watch for his huge combos. If he isn't hit with enough Wither stacks, definitely do that before getting his HP low. If you happen to have a couple of Dark Energy and/or a charged up Dark Matter, this fight is an excellent time to use them. If you have a couple, try using them right after using the break technicks and then try to finish off at least Ghis before he starts throwing Elixirs. Having applied a bunch of status ailments to the judges before this is also a great idea. Good luck with this one!!
