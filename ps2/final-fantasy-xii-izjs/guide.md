***TODO***: Review and update these paragraphs and achievement counts

This is not an official manual, walkthrough, or critical review. This document is a guide for the current achievement set (208 achievements as of March 11, 2024) available on [RetroAchievements](https://retroachievements.org/game/2721). This guide will give the player tips on earning the achievements, hash compatibility, and any other necessary or useful information. It may point to other resources for specific game walkthroughs that are not focused on the achievements themselves.

As with some of the other guides I've made, spoiler solutions for the boss strategies and a potential order to earning the achievements will be hidden in a collapsible entry that you must click to expand so that only the solutions you need assistance with will be viewable. Some of the more minor achievements will have strategies written outright without a collapsible dropdown so use the guide at your own risk.

## Introduction

***TODO***: Update these paragraphs to discuss FF12

Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King is a role-playing video game developed by Level-5 and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation 2. Released in Japan in November 2004 and then throughout the world between 2005 and 2006, it is the eighth installment in the Dragon Quest series. It is also the first game in the series to have a release in European regions as well as the first to finally have the "Dragon Quest" name, rather than "Dragon Warrior", in the United States. Additionally, it is the first game in the series to use fully 3D environment and characters, rather than 2D pixel art. It leverages cel-shading techniques to make Akira Toriyama's character and monster designs really shine in the 3D style.

Dragon Quest VIII continues the traditional story and gameplay styles of the previous games, using small vignettes across an overarching plot, iconic monster designs, a nameless and silent hero character with hidden abilities, and randomly encountered turn-based combat with experience points. A new alchemy system is introduced to create a new item out of two or three existing stock after a certain number of steps are walked. A skill point system enables character customization, forcing the player to make permanent choices with each level around weapons and attributes that can unlock new abilities and spells.

As with other role-playing games, Dragon Quest VIII will push you into situations that can lock you out of areas, characters, and abilities as you progress. As a result, many achievements for this game can become missable if you are not diligent. However, all achievements can be earned in one playthrough. This guide will attempt to help you in identifying the missable achievements if you'd rather not play this fantastic, but lengthy, game multiple times.

## Trivia

***TODO***: Update these bullets about FF12 and specifically the IZJS version

- Dragon Quest was called "Dragon Warrior" in the United States due to a trademark conflict with a tabletop role-playing game called [DragonQuest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DragonQuest). The US trademark expired in the early 2000s and Square Enix was able to use the series name in USA for the first time once they took over the trademark.

- The series, created by Yuji Horii, was inspired by western computer role-playing games Wizardry and Ultima, while incorporating a streamlined user interface more appropriate for a console video game experience. The first Dragon Quest's user interface is based off a Famicom port of Horii's game The Portopia Serial Murder Case, which used a command menu to get user input. Horii was frustrated with text-based entry of PC text adventure games and opted to have a command menu to simplify things.

- Many monsters were designed by famed mangaka Akira Toriyama, creator of Dragon Ball and many other manga and anime series. Perhaps arguably the most iconic and widely known monster is the Slime. Horii provided Toriyama [a sketch of a slime](https://bsky.app/profile/betterlegends.bsky.social/post/3kn6x6eufh622) based on Horii's playthroughs of Wizardry and Toriyama drew the teardrop shape with a smile that we are all familiar with.

- This achievement set, created by [TheMysticalOne](https://retroachievements.org/user/TheMysticalOne), makes good use of alliteration and puns similar to the style of Dragon Quest games. Early localizations of Dragon Quest to North America lacked the punny humor of the series, but Dragon Quest VIII's localization really set the standard for future games and remakes of the older games going forward. Spells started to use onomatopoeia names (like Kaboom instead of Explodet and Woosh instead of Infernos) similar to the Japanese style for spells while monster and town names started to lean in a punny direction.

- Dragon Quest VIII was ported to mobile phones and the 3DS. The 3DS version, in particular, adds two new playable characters and a bunch of quality of life improvements such as being able to speed up battle animations and instant alchemy pot brewing as soon as the feature is unlocked.

- The western release of Dragon Quest VIII added the affect of giving Hero a "Super Saiyan" appearance when hitting max tension. The [Dragon Quest wiki](https://dragon-quest.org/wiki/Tension) states that this was added specifically to the western releases as a shout out to fans of Toriyama's work, but I could not find any other sources that confirm if that is indeed the reason.

## Save Support

***TODO***: This section is mostly good, but need to specify more details about saving specifically for FF12

The game uses PS2 memory cards to save games with 30 save slots per card. Since this is being played with the PCSX2 emulator for RetroAchievements support, it is **HIGHLY** recommended that you make use of all slots in order to minimize the possibility of being locked out of a missable achievement. You can even make more than one memory card file to make saves across multiple memory cards. In my playthrough experience, I only needed one memory card, but I used 27 slots so I got close to needing more than one memory card.

## Compatibility

***TODO***: Update links, etc.

Currently (as of March 11, 2024) this game has 2 unique hashes registered for it. View the linked hashes at the [Supported Game Files](https://retroachievements.org/linkedhashes.php?g=2721) page. This includes a [60fps patch](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAPatches/blob/main/PS2/Improvement/2721-DQ8-60FPS.zip), if that is the sort of thing you enjoy.

Please view the [Dragon Quest VIII Official Forum Topic](https://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=16644) for more details.

## Leaderboards

***TODO***: Update the links to leaderboards for FF12

## Achievement Categories

***TODO***: Obviously will overhaul this...

There are a currently (as of March 11, 2024) a total of 208 achievements, which can be broken down into the following categories:

- **[Story/Progression](#storyprogression)**: 32 achievements earned naturally through the course of gameplay (only up to the game's normal ending)

- **[Challenge](#challenge)**: 24 achievements (**23 are missable**) that require special action during boss fights or meet a condition throughout the entire game
- **[Lists](#lists)**: 34 achievements (**1 is missable**) involve progression toward and completing the various lists that are in game, such as alchemy recipes and the monster bestiary
- **[Grind](#grind)**: 29 achievements (**3 are missable**) that use actions taken by characters in battle a specific number of times or may require multiple battles to meet the requirements, as well as skill point category maxing and alchemy grinding
- **[Item Exchange](#item-exchange)**: 6 achievements, a subset of the Lists category, for Dodgy Dave and Princess Minnie, exchanging the specific alchemy items and mini-medals for certain rewards
- **[Monster Arena](#monster-arena)**: 8 achievements, a subset of the Side Quest category, for advancing in the monster arena and other arena related quests
- **[Treasure](#treasure)**: 17 achievements (**3 are missable**) which require finding all treasure chests in a given region or dungeon

Out of all of the achievements, a total of **53 are missable**

## Potential Order

***TODO***: Obviously will overhaul this...

The following is a breakdown of the order of achievements based on my personal playthrough. Note that this is only a potential order for you to follow and not a strict timing on when achievements should be unlocked, especially when grind achievements are considered.

Each section is grouped under story achievements and hidden under a dropdown to avoid spoilers. If you want to see the achievements, **click on the arrow** next to each section to reveal the table. The dropdown names have the number of achievements in the section so that you can see at a glance about how many achievements you should have by the end of a section, if you were to follow my guide to the letter. If you want to see the entire thing without having to click the arrows, [checkout the fully expanded roadmap!](Dragon-Quest-VIII-Roadmap)

:no_entry: **MINOR SPOILER SECTION** :no_entry:
<br>The tables only reveal when achievements can be earned and possibly missed. No strategies on earning the achievements are provided here, just the approximate order I earned them in.

**Grind alert!** The final stretch will require a significant amount of time getting the remaining skill maxing as well as getting Hero to level 65 for the Dragon Soul ability. While there are probably plenty of good lower level strategies to beating the Dragovian Trials, it's probably more efficient to just get the levels and skills you need before completing the final Trial. In my playthrough, I made occasional breaks from metal slime grinding to go do a Dragovian Trial, and then head back to the grind. Have fun!

## Category Breakdowns

***TODO***: Obviously will overhaul all of this...

The category sections below contain each achievement in the section with tips or suggestions on how to unlock them. Not every achievement may warrant an in-depth discussion and the tips/suggestions I provide may not be the the most ideal. I'm open to feedback on how better to meet an achievement's requirements, as I have done with my previous guides. Feel free to [message me via RetroAchievements DM](https://retroachievements.org/messages/create?to=bdjeffyp) to discuss better strategies and I'll update them here with credit given.

Good luck in your achievement hunting!

### General advice

The following is some overall strategies to make your playthrough and achievement hunting with Dragon Quest VIII as painless as possible, while also completing your mastery in one run.

- **Alchemy recipe tracking**: I created a [checklist for tracking your progress on alchemy recipes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ce8GHR2nSsI-ArWagsF2-yS-t5rjWYEyFdRzfKcDAE/edit?usp=sharing) on Google Sheets. I didn't like that the [100% walkthrough guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/43062) didn't identify what the recipes made. It was also noted by RA user [Akai](https://retroachievements.org/user/Akai) in the [I Did 'Em Alchemyself achievement forums](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250749) that the 100% guide was missing one recipe. So, I used both the 100% guide as well as [Dragon's Den recipe guide](https://www.woodus.com/den/games/dq83ds/alchemy.php) to put together the checklist. The order of the recipes in the same as the 100% guide, with the one missing recipe at the very end of the list. With this checklist, I made sure to complete all recipes and verified its accuracy and completeness.

- **Saving**: Please, please, please, PLEASE make full use of your memory card! The last thing you want to do is make all of your saves on one slot. Dragon Quest VIII provides you with 30 slots per memory card. I am reiterating what was stated in the [Save Support](#save-support) section it is just that important. The best time to make a new save is just prior to making an attempt on a Challenge category achievement. Having multiple saves definitely helped me in a couple of instances where I missed an achievement because of a small timing window. Please don't forget to make use of all that space!

- **Dungeons and boss challenges**: The nature of how save games work in Dragon Quest games, combined with the [Peerless Protector](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250136) achievement's requirement, make dealing with dungeons and boss fight challenges a different level of tricky as compared to a typical Final Fantasy boss achievement. The way I mitigated these types of challenge achievements is by breaking up dungeons in two visits, when possible. The first visit (or more, if needed) is for clearing out the dungeon of treasures. Once that is done, Evac and Zoom to town to save. The next visit will then be for the attempts at the boss challenge. The nice thing about this approach is that death doesn't undo as much work when reverting to a previous save in order to maintain [Peerless Protector](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250136) while also ensuring that you are keeping your experience AND your money earned. If things get too spicy in a dungeon, don't be afraid to Evac early to recover and save your progress. This approach also helps with increasing distance traveled, brewing alchemy recipes, and maintaining new encounters logged in the bestiary.

- **Other guides**: The first time I played through Dragon Quest VIII completely was on the 3DS but I certainly didn't accomplish 100% of the game in that playthrough. In order to make sure I didn't miss anything while mastering this achievement set, the primary guide I utilized is the [100% walkthrough guide on GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/43062). As with most guides, there are bound to be errors but this one was nearly perfect. I also used the [Spells and Skills guide on GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/583527-dragon-quest-viii-journey-of-the-cursed-king/faqs/40285) for identifying my skill point distribution route. Also handy were the Dragon's Den overworld maps that identify [treasures](https://www.woodus.com/den/gallery/graphics/dq8ps2/maps_overworld/tresure_chests.webp), [notorious monsters](https://www.woodus.com/den/gallery/graphics/dq8ps2/maps_overworld/infamous_monsters.webp), and [cow locations](https://www.woodus.com/den/gallery/graphics/dq8ps2/maps_overworld/DQ8_Cows_Map.webp)!

#### Boss Challenges

:no_entry: **HERE, THERE BE SPOILERS!** :no_entry:

Boss challenges provide a unique spin on typical boss fights, forcing you to take actions you would not normally do in a casual playthough. These tend to become interesting puzzles to figure out. If you wish to challenge yourself, I recommend not expanding the strategies I used. As a reminder, the flexibility of the combat system means that my strategies are not the hard and fast rule to meeting the requirements of the achievement. If you have recommended solutions to these challenges, I'd be more than happy to add them here. Just [send me a DM on RetroAchievements](https://retroachievements.org/messages/create?to=bdjeffyp)!

### Grind

My overall strategy when grinding is as follows:
- **Combat**: Once you have the Godbird's soulstone, you can fly to Howlwind Hill, also known as Slime Hill, located just north of Rydon's Tower. All slime family enemies are here, including metal slime variants. Just stay in one spot, Whistle for an encounter, and fight! Mercurial/Lightning Thrust and Hatchet Man/Executioner are your friend. Unfortunately, after completing the Black Citadel, dark slimes and sabrecats will also appear here, which can slow down the amount of metal slimes that make an appearance... Prior to the Black Citadel, metal slimes seem to appear frequently at all times. After Black Citadel, they only really seem to appear most at night. In other news, I seemed like I was able to intimidate more enemies during the postgame so I built up my intimidate count here too. I did check out the unexplored island and found the liquid metal slime appearance rate to be too little compared to Slime Hill. Getting the Metal King Boomerang can help with the regular metal slime groups that show up too. I was able to take down a 6 out of 9 metal slimes using that boomerang along with Executioner and Angelo with a metal king sword.
    - I am a big fan of seeing this encounter which seemed to show up a decent amount during my time on Slime Hill before the Black Citadel:
![An enemy encounter consisting of a Metal King Slime flanked by three Liquid Metal Slimes on both sides](https://i.imgur.com/LArc2KJ.png)
- **Alchemy brewing**: Before getting the instant pot, once I got the Hilltop Hut zoom spot unlocked, I use the fenced in area outside the hut to run in circles while fast forwarding the emulator at 300%. This was also a useful spot for speeding up Medea's water consumption when working on getting Mystical Spring scenes for [Enduring Endearment](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/250124).

### Treasure

In this section, I am only going to highlight the missable treasure achievements rather than discuss all of them, since there are plenty of other resources out there that already go into detail on this. The main thing to keep in mind is that a lot of the region treasure achievements will require revisits later, either with the magic key or ultimate key. So don't worry if you finish a scenario in a region and you don't have the associated treasure achievement unlocked yet.

One major note: **Don't forget that mimics COUNT** toward opening all treasure chests in a region or dungeon.

For convenience sake, here are the guides that are helpful in finding all of the treasures:

## Notes

Okay, so right now I've only barely started the game and am just taking some notes to figure things out and see if I even want to continue with this guide...

Some things I've noticed so far:
- Not sure if all of the missables are actually called out. This is a set Snow participated in, though siouxerskate did the majority of the achievements and marked plenty of missables so perhaps it is accurate. It's something I'll need to be hyper-vigilant for, of course.
- Shortly after completing the tutorial Hunt for the Rogue Tomato and the cutscenes that follow when returning to Rabanastre, primed achievement markers appear for two missable achievements: A Crucial Piece and Quick as the Wind.
  - A Crucial Piece is for obtaining the Diamond Armlet early. This requires going to Dalmasca Westersand: Windtrace Dunes area and opening chest 36 which has a 25% appearance rate (according to Fandom wiki...). I'm still figuring out where chest 36 will spawn currently.
  - Quick as the Wind is for getting the Gladius dagger early. It's found in Dalmasca Estersand: The Yoma area and opening chest 48 (item 2 in the chest, which appears 75% of the time and has a 35% chance of just being gil, according to Fandom wiki... I believe this has really low odds overall). Getting to this location during the period the achievement asks for as well as the chest location is unknown currently. Further research shows that the intent for this achievement is to steal it from the Lindbur Wolf in Dalmasca Westersand: Shimmering Horizons (it appears after chaining 20+ wolves) in the separate area in the northeast.
- Looks like a collection of maps for the Zodiac versions of the game, to include IZJS, is found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1292596668.
- There are a bunch of boss fight achievements that have specific restrictions. Most include preventing use of the Seitengrat and have a level cap. So keeping an eye on levels will be important to call out.
  - The restriction "No HP to 0" means that no party members can die during the boss fight.
- Getting the Seitengrat will be its own special bit of fun, involving RNG manipulation, because it is incredibly rare to appear.
- The F.I.N.A.L. F.A.N.T.A.S.Y. achievement requires the collection of special weapons that have a letter at the end of their name, such as the Scorpion Tail F hammer. It's only missable because if you sell any of them, then you'll not unlock this.
- The Sky Pirate's Den is an internal achievement system the IZJS version implemented. Naturally, the set ties achievements to the statues that appear in the Den. There is an unfortunate issue with how the game stores if these statues are unlocked for some of the achievements that requires opening up the Sky Pirate's Den to unlock the achievement. If you save and quit the game with the statue unlocked and not the achievement, you'll miss these particular achievements because of save protection that was implemented.
  - There is no notification that you unlock something in the Sky Pirate's Den. It's up to the player to check it after before saving and quitting their play session.
- The Where is the Zodiac Spear? achievement is going to be a pain point I believe. You have to check the Necrohol of Nabudis' Cloister of the Highborn for chest 22, which as a 3% spawn rate to find the Ensanguined Shield. The name of this achievement is a reference to the fact that this chest is the one that would have the Zodiac Spear if the requirements were met. The other reason why this is a pain point is because you need to go to this location and find this chest with the shield before entering the Sochen Cave Palace for the first time. If I remember right, you pass by the Necrohol on the way to Sochen and comments from characters state that the Necrohol is dangerous and you should go there and it is never required by the story. I see talk about the [Immobilize Glitch](https://antifandom.com/finalfantasy/wiki/Immobilize_glitch) which may be helpful for traversing the area while low leveled that may still work in IZJS.
- RNG manipulation really seems to be the name of the game here in getting some of these rare things to appear. Either that, or a shit ton of patience...
- Overall, the set is a disordered mess. Achievements are all over the place and don't follow a logical flow. I can understand that some of them may not be possible (like the Sky Pirate's Den achievements) though... My roadmap may be able to help some here.
- There are achievements for various rewards from the Hunt Club outfitters. If I remember right, there are some mutually exclusive options here? This may require multiple saves or saving before hand to select one and then the other. I'll need to dig into that more when I get to that area.
- Trial mode is separate from the main game and the achievements are similarly separate. There is only one missable involving stealing the Excalibur from and defeating Hell Wyrm. Working on Trial Mode will be reserved for the post game file.

Overall, I can see this as being a set that puts people off because there are so many achievements and everything is seemingly disorganized (though I think I understand the layout a bit more).

I'll focus these notes for now on the achievements that take place between the story beats (i.e. the progression achievements).

### General things to remember

- There are achievements associated with the bestiary. When entering new places, you may want to take the time to scout for enemies you haven't fought before. None of the bestiary achievements (**Hunter of Monsters I through IV**, **Big Game Hunter I and II**, and **Show Off I and II**) are marked as missable, so in theory you should be able to go back to most locations and find all the monsters in the game.
  - Currently, I don't believe that this requires the full bestiary entry either (fighting the same monster until the entry adds a second page). The achievement measurement increases as soon as an interaction with a new monster occurs, even when an NPC fights a new monster.
  - I'm noticing that **Big Game Hunter I and II** and **Show Off I and II** don't seem to have measured tracking. I'm guessing maybe the set devs felt the smaller quantity of entries was worth not bothering with the tracking?
- It's good to only sell the correct number of loot items that you need to complete unlocking bazaar packages. Selling too many will not "carry over" to another package if that item is used to unlock multiple packages. This is mostly important to remember when dealing with rarer loot.
- While rare game may appear as you explore areas on the way to the next boss or story moment, it's probably wise to only fight rare game IF it shows up, rather than trying to force their appearance. This is to ensure that levels are kept low to avoid getting close to the level caps for boss challenges. If you feel that your levels may be lagging a bit, that shouldn't be a problem, but keep extra save files just in case. I will do a rare game (and bestiary) cleanup after finishing the game to ensure that my levels don't get too high.
- Guest characters levels will matter when worrying about the level caps for boss challenges. A guest character level will be calculated when they join with the following calculation:
  - Larsa and Reddas: average of the two highest level characters + 2 levels
  - Vossler: average of the two highest level characters + 4 levels
  - *Example*: You have a party of levels 14, 14, 15, 15, 15, 16. Vossler joins. His level will be 19 because 4 plus 15 (15 and 16 average rounded down).

### Jobs

For the most part, job selection doesn't matter too much other than making your game play experience easier or more challenging. Ideally, you will want to pick jobs that are varied so that you can form teams of three that can act in the primary roles of Tank (takes the hits and enemy aggro), Healer (heals the party and provides other support), and the damage dealer also known as the DPS for "damage per second" (doles out the primary damage to the enemies). Here is the job assignments I gave my characters, based on what some sources were stating is the "popular" choice, with some exception:
- Vaan: Monk
- Penelo: Black Mage
- Balthier: White Mage
- Fran: Red Mage (Highly recommended for the **Ward of the Wood** challenge)
- Basch: Knight (I've seen people use Archer, but I went with Knight for a second Tank)
- Ashe: Samurai

An issue with this particular setup is the achievements requiring use of the Poach skill. Poach is easily accessible on the license board for the Uhlan, Machinist, Time Mage, and Archer. It is also available for Black Mage if that job is assigned to Vaan, Balthier, or Fran because they naturally have the Steal license. Since I used Penelo for Black Mage and none of the other jobs were assigned in my party, I **MUST** give Penelo the Zalera summon in order to access Steal and then Poach. The only affect of this that I see is Vaan losing access to Traveler and Ashe can't get the Blood Sword licenses because of this.

Fran is a particularly tough choice because her stats are lower than everyone elses so no jobs are particularly suited for her over any other. This is why I felt Red Mage made the most sense with her as that class typically is known for being a "jack of all trades but master of none". Turns out that Red Mage or Black Mage is an ideal choice for the **Ward of the Wood** challenge. Of course, there are other ways to handle this challenge that people have discussed in the achievement's comments and I'll bring them up there.

***TODO***: If I see any other potential gotchas with achievements and the jobs, write about them here.

### Sky Pirate's Den Notes

**Cartographer**: This requires having entered every zone in all regions (except for one-time visit locations, the final dungeon, and areas without a mini-map). Purchasing/finding maps will enable you to just enter a zone to consider an area "fully explored" without having to light up every inch of a zone.

**Assault Striker**: Unlocked when the metric was hit without needing to go into the Den (makes sense as the game probably has a very easy value to check for number of times Attack is used).

**Master Thief**: Unlocked when the metric was hit without needing to go into the Den.

**Premier Prestidigitator**: Unlocked when the metric was reached without needing to go to the Den.

**Wayfarer**: This unlocked when I saved the game as I hit 50,010 steps. Perhaps these achievements got updated to fix the issue regarding the ones that explicitly state to check the Sky Pirate's Den so that they'll unlock when saving the game?

**The Unrelenting**: This unlocked as soon as I hit 50-chain.

**Blood Dancer**: This unlocked as soon as I hit the 500 enemies defeated point.

**Spellsinger**: This unlocked as soon as I hit 200 spells used.

**Plunderer**: This unlocked as soon as I accumulated over 100,000 gil during the game (don't have to have that amount all at once).

### Some Mechanics Notes

- You can force a character to be a Tank type by casting Decoy on them. This Green Magick spell becomes available from the Clan Provisioner when you have completed two hunts (generally Rogue Tomato and Thextera are the first two).
  - Having the Bubble Belt or casting Bubble on the decoy'd character makes them even more tanky by doubling their HP!
- While the chance for a character or enemy to do a combo is based on the RNG position, the number of attacks done in a combo is weighted by the remaining HP a character has. The lower the HP, the greater chance of doing higher combos. Being HP Critical can net you 8 or more hits in one attack!
- Putting Reflect on your party members and using attack spells on the party will hit nearby enemies with that spell three times in one cast. Having two party members slinging spells at your party brings that up to six. Seems like a good strategy for bosses that have elemental weaknesses!

### A Treaty Signed With Steel ➡️ Exit Stage Right

For RNG manipulation using Reks, while going through the prologue, you'll come across a Save Crystal. Use it and set aside a save slot for Reks in the prologue. Make the save after passing the room with the Save Crystal and Reks tells Basch to head toward the King while he handles the soldiers approaching from the back. You'll use this save to set up RNG for other saves using the [RNG Helper](https://github.com/blakehartley/RNGHelper/releases) tool. You can use the other party members in other saves as well, but it sounds like Reks makes things easier. Keep a save handy just in case. When you need to use Reks for RNG manipulation, you'll load the save and then head downstairs from the Save Crystal where soldiers spawn infinitely to get the values you need to record into the RNG Helper tool.

The first achievement to unlock will be **A Treaty Signed With Steel** for completing the prologue with Reks.

***Level Caps***: The first level cap for boss fight challenges is level 12. It is a ways off but if you approach level 9 or 10, consider escaping from fights where you are able.

**Zodiac's Calling** (Characters): After gaining control of Vaan, following the story beats that take you to The Sandsea, and learning about hunts at the Hunt Board, you'll gain access to the license board and picking a job. Select the job you want to give to Vaan to unlock this achievement. For the record, I'm using the following jobs:
- Vaan: Monk
- Penelo: Black Mage
- Balthier: White Mage
- Fran: Red Mage (highly recommended for a later challenge)
- Basch: Knight
- Ashe: Samurai

**A Small Deed** (Side quest): This is missable and requires speaking to a seemingly random NPC in Rabanastre: Southern Plaza. Near the fountain in the plaza is a Bangaa labeled as Desert Merchant speaking with an Imperial Guard. Talk to them and accept their request to get a Small Package. Once you go through the door to Eastgate, you can no longer go back and speak to the Bangaa again, missing this achievement. Give the Small Package to another Bangaa labeled as Hapless Merchant located near the Save Crystal to get... nothing but this achievement. Selling the Small Package without giving it to the Hapless Merchant would also prevent getting this.

**Cartographer** (Sky Pirate's Den): To unlock this, you need to "fully explore" each area in the game. However, purchasing maps from the Cartographer's Guild will count an area as fully explored when you purchase the associated map. The first guild moogle is found in Rabanastre: Southern Plaza in an alcove in the northwest. Purchase the three maps that they have on hand when you have the funds. It'll cost 630 gil total to get all three.

**Red & Rotten in the Desert** (Hunts): This is the first Hunt you'll get in the game, acting as a tutorial of sorts for how they work and how these marks are different from normal fiends. The Rogue Tomato is found in the first area outside of Rabanastre: Eastgate, in Dalmasca Estersand: The Stepping. The mark is located on an elevated location near the center of the area. See the map here and look for the "M": https://images.steamusercontent.com/ugc/942811548910289216/429DC77D3A719DE762BF2B2F9C138CCC9CE06A49/. You can defeat it at level 1 fairly easily. I stole a Pebble from it and then attacked for the remainder of the fight and had just over half health remaining by the end. Defeat the fiend, go through the events that allow reentry into Rabanastre, then let Tomaj, the hunt petitioner, know you were successful to receive the reward and the achievement. After getting the reward, I got the bill for and accepted the Thextera hunt from the Hunt Board and Gatsly in The Sandsea.

Upon gaining control of Vaan after returning to Rabanastre and seeing the cutscenes, the **A Crucial Piece** and **Quick As the Wind** achievements will be primed. I assume that these show up to inform the player that events that lock out these missables (speaking to Old Dalan after completing his quest) is coming up.
- Note that these achievements mention "returning to Old Dalan" and "giving a sunstone to Old Dalan". That means that you can visit Dalan to get the quest moving and then work on getting these two achievements.
- Make the Sunstone in the Giza Plains with Penelo now in your party. Set her job if you wish and feel free to gain some license points and a level or two (the first level gate is 12, so that's a ways off).
- Once the Sunstone is made, do NOT return to Lowtown and Dalan. You will miss these primed achievements. Worst case, if getting them is taking a long time and you want to move on, make a save and use a new save slot for your continued progress so you can return here later and try again. I confirmed that the achievements become missable on the return visit to Dalan, when the cutscene in Garamsythe Waterway is shown after handing over the Sunstone.
- Having Penelo with you to get these two items and achievements will be invaluable. She can heal while Vaan steals. I'll get to the details in a moment.
- Doing these before progressing the story further means you can't program Gambits yet. That'll make things a bit more manual, unfortunately.

**Ivalice Explorer** (???): On the way to Lowtown and the Giza Plains for the Sunstone quest, you'll find your first Teleport Save Crystal at Rabanastre: South Gate. This will be the first of many! Use it to register the location (and perhaps save your game) so that you can use a Teleport Stone to warp to it from any other orange crystal.

**A Crucial Piece** (Treasure?): While grinding on gaining chain on wolves in Dalmasca Westersand, take the northwest exit of the Shimmering Horizons zone into an isolated area of Windtrace Dunes. This location is very dangerous at this point in the game, so it's a good idea to turn battle speed down and just hold onto R2 to stay in Escape mode as you make your way across the zone to the exit. The Windtrace Dunes has two Alraune and an Alpha Wolf guarding the area and the chest has a 25% chance to spawn (chest 36 on the map: https://images.steamusercontent.com/ugc/942811548910304149/C750608AD179F650595FD0DE2FF9316976429BA1/). It shouldn't take too long to get it to show up but it may be ideal to hop into the nearby entrance to Zertinan Caverns to deaggro the enemies, if needed, and ensure the treasures in the Windtrace Dunes reset. Stock up on Potions to heal up as needed. I first tried to get this at level 2, which was a disaster. I got up to level 4 and was able to take more damage, but I was also being more cautious in avoiding aggro. It seems like the Alraune like to hang out on the path around to where the chest spawns so if there is an opening, you can run along the right side to a cliff that overlooks where the chest and Alpha Wolf hang out to see if it has spawned or not. Once the chest has spawned, as soon as you grab it, the achievement will unlock. So, if you don't want to bother with keeping it for now and wait to get it later, simply reset or die to get back to your last save and carry on with the game. 
- Note about chests: I believe they only require one screen transition to respawn in this version, but I'm not 100% certain on that. My initial tests are showing that this is true.

**Quick As the Wind** (Rare Items? Stealing?): While trying to get levels for **A Crucial Piece**, I found that the Hyenas in Giza Plains count toward the wolf chain (I believe this is because of the type of the fiend in the bestiary). Unfortunately, it does not seem that this will cause the Lindbur Wolf to spawn... I had 24 chain from hyenas and went to the spawn location but it was a no-show. Thankfully, fighting Westersand wolves at level 4 isn't terrible at all. From Giza Plains: Starfall Field, take the west exit out to Dalmasca Westersand: Shimmering Horizons. Start taking out wolves all around the Westersand and building up chain (Alpha Wolf, regular Wolf, and even Hyenas on Giza Plains count). Keep in mind that entering any safe areas or interacting with a Save Crystal will reset your chain. Once the chain reaches 20, head to the isolated section of Shimmering Horizons. Some sources say that chain is not required, however building chain makes it very easy to keep track. The Lindbur Wolf should be present. Slow down the battle speed all the way so that you have time to run out of the zone in an emergency. Queue up the Steal action on Vaan while not aggroing the target until the action is ready, then approach and try to get the steal. Run right back to the exit of the zone to avoid taking damage if at all possible. If you made a Black Mage (ideally on Penelo), you can Blind the Lindbur Wolf with the spell you find in Giza Plains: Toam Hills. A lot of people seemed to find getting levels and HP on Vaan was helpful, but I wanted to find a way to get this without grinding. Unfortunately, it did mean having to lock Penelo into a specific job in the beginning, but thankfully it was a job I wanted her to have. There are plenty of other strategies people gave in the achievement's comments as well. I tried landing Blind and stealing at level 4 and didn't have much luck. I was doing better at level 5, but death still came quickly when the monster was able to land blows, despite having elevated HP. I managed a lucky encounter with a Fideliant (contributing toward **Show Off I and II**) in the Westersand's Midfault while passing through which got me level 6 with one Phoenix Down to kill it. When I succeeded after a couple of tries and getting the rhythm down for the setup and execution of the strategy, I was at level 6, buffed up Vaan to 566 HP from the license board with the Monk class, and Penelo with Blind and a couple of Magick Lore spots unlocked. Turn off Gambits for Vaan and Penelo. Penelo opens with Blind, which would land after one or two tries (I have seen that there is a flat 75% chance on vulnerable fiends but also varying chance based on a formula, not sure what to believe there...), while Vaan queues up Steal. There is a 3% chance of getting the Gladius. While trying to get Blind to proc, inch back toward the exit of the zone as you continue to try to steal or heal up Vaan. If Blind is taking too many attempts, escape the zone and reassess if you need to heal up, get more resources, or start over. After Blind is affecting the Lindbur Wolf, Vaan concentrates on Steal while Penelo heals with potions. Supplement Vaan using potions if too many attacks land in a row, or use a Hi-Potion if you have some to top Vaan up quickly. Repeat until you run out of resources and escape or die (death is better so that you don't have to gather resources again) or you steal the dagger and run away or die. I finally got it on my third attempt after about 75+ steals across all attempts. Your mileage and strategy may vary greatly based on your jobs, levels, resources on hand, and luck. Also, if you did manage to get the Gladius very quickly and feel lucky, you could try to take out the Lindbur Wolf for credit toward **Show Off I and II**, but it might be pushing your luck with the low levels and attacks still getting through Blind.
- ***TODO***: Definitely overhaul this explanation!

**Wolf in the Waste** (Hunts): After all of the prep for getting the Gladius from the Lindbur Wolf, I was more than ready to take on Thextera. This fight could probably be easily done at level 4 or 5 even, though the Call for Help skill will add more wolves to the fight and make this a bit more difficult. Also, Thextera will become more evasive and counter more at half health. Just heal up if HP gets low and keep the press on to win. Return to The Sandsea to report success for your reward. Also, get the next hunt (Flowering Cactoid) from the Hunt Board.
- After completing this hunt, you can find Gatsly has moved to Rabanastre: Muthru Bazaar, nearby the Clan Provisioner. Speak to them here and they'll mention that a new bazaar item is in stock for us to buy: a Forgotten Grimoire. This one, when purchased for 18,000 gil, will become the Hunter's Monograph. Purchasing your first Monograph will unlock the **Tale Of the Forgotten Grimoire** achievement. You may not have the funds to get this now (I sure didn't), but you'll get this and many others throughout the game to eventually get the **Epic of the Forgotten Grimoires** achievement.
- There are several other monographs that you can unlock as well at this point if you wish:
  - ***TODO***: Validate the translations of these names...
  - Knight's Monograph (19,000 gil): Speak to a weapon shop owner 30 times
  - Warmage's Monograph (20,000 gil): Check the Hunt Board 20 times
  - Mage's Monograph (21,000 gil): Talk to a magick shop owner 25 times
  - Dragoon's Monograph (22,000 gil): Check the Hunt Board 40 times
  - Scholar's Monograph (22,000 gil): Speak with a armor shop owner 15 times
  - Sage's Monograph (25,000 gil): Speak with any merchant 100 times
  - There is one more but is not unlockable until much later on...
  - You do not have to do these all at once or right now even. These will unlock naturally over the course of the game, but you can get them out of the way now as well, if you wish. Of course, you will definitely not be able to afford them until you are able to get more cash more readily, but having them available when you need them later could be nice.

**Dalmasca's Desert Bloom** (Hunts): The Flowering Cactoid's petitioner, Dantro, is in Dalmasca Estersand: The Output on some crates talking with a Seeq. Talk to him to start the hunt. You'll find the mark in the next area to the north, Yardang Labyrinth (https://images.steamusercontent.com/ugc/942811548910289247/11541936057BE83353922538CE5E88550DD99B5B/). Unlike other Cactoids in the vicinity, the Flowering Cactoid is more evasive and will try to run away and heal if you don't chase after it. Because of how it flees, it's a good idea to try to clear out the other fiends in the vicinity to minimize the additional encounters. If you went with having Penelo as a Black Mage, having Blind and Fire is very helpful. Blind doesn't reduce the chance of getting hit as much as it did for the Lindbur Wolf, but it can help. Fire will just do more damage and can even hit the mark as it runs off. When Flowering Cactoid has less than 20% HP remaining, it'll start to use the 1000 Needles skill which will undoubtedly kill off a party member at lower levels. Just be prepared to use a Phoenix Down right after it uses the attack so that it doesn't take out the other party member. Of course, you can save this for later in the game, but it was easy enough to accomplish with just Vaan and Penelo at level 6. If you have any Dark or Aero Motes, those can be very useful to finish off the enemy before 1000 Needles fires off as well. Return to Dantro to get the reward. Talk to him one more time to learn what to do with the Cactus Flower.

**Covered Up In Flowers/Treasure Hunter Mog** (Side Quest): Getting the Cactus Flower and talking to Dantro twice kicks off the start of these side quests. Head north to South Bank Village and talk to the Villager near the door of a house by the pier. She mentions that there is an ill villager inside. If you didn't talk to Dantro twice, you won't know that she's the one to bring the Cactus Flower to. Handing over the Cactus Flower will net you a Bundle of Needles. Speak with Dantro's Wife once again to learn that she needs Semclam Shells. You will want to get five of them in order to ensure you get the best reward. Two are in the beach water in the village and the other three are along the beach outside the village. They appear as Mysterious Glints. Bring all five back to Dantro's Wife (don't bring her any amounts lower than 5 or the quest will continue and the rewards will be worse). She'll now say that she needs Nebralim, which Dantro can help with. Go back to The Outpost again and Dantro will tell you to help yourself to the items. There are two Small Phials around the Outpost: one on an urn to the south of Dantro, the other north of Dantro on an urn next to a chocobo. Take them back to Dantro's Wife. Now she'll ask for Valeblossom Dew. This is not accessible yet, however. The rest of the quest will be finished later. This could be saved for later as well, but if you completed the Flowering Cactoid hunt, it doesn't hurt to get this fetch quest out of the way.

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: If you went through the trouble of starting the Cactus Flower/Treasure Hunter Mog side quests, you'll be rewarded with access to your second Teleport Save Crystal.

Upon returning to Old Dalan, Penelo will leave the party. Once you have the Crescent Stone and have headed into Garamsythe Waterway, I recommend making a new save file at the Save Crystal here. It'll be some time before you can return to Rabanastre once you enter the palace (the game will tell you twice that you are about to reach a point of no return) and some things will change. If you haven't accomplished some of the early game missables, an old save prior to this point will be a good spot for coming back later to clean those up.

**Show Off I and II** (Bestiary?): While traversing Garamsythe Waterway and entering the North Spur Sluiceway zone, you may find the Razorfin rare game here, as it has a 10% chance of spawning instead of the normal Ichthons that continually appear as you cull their numbers. If you see a larger flying fish, you'll have found it. It's probably not worth grinding for it now, given that there is a level gate approaching. However, if it appears upon entering the zone (like it did for me), feel free to take it out! It's not too tough to beat at level 7 and I imagine that level 6 or 5 might still be okay. Also, if you have the Firefly and insist on getting the rare game now, you might consider putting that on to avoid XP accumulation if your levels are getting too high.

**Cartographer** (cont'd): A green urn with the map of the Royal Palace of Rabanastre is behind Vaan as soon as you are in control after entering the area. While the achievement states that one-time areas are excluded from getting this Sky Pirate's Den statue, I'm not taking any chances (getting this map later in the game costs 100,000 gil if you miss it here). I'd be interested to know if missing this actually doesn't matter though.

### Exit Stage Right ➡️ She Airship Enough For You

***Level Cap Reminder***: The first level cap in the set is approaching soon. You must be at or under level 12 before the Mimic Queen fight.

Once you have Balthier and Fran in the party and learned about gambits, feel free to set up their jobs and use the license points they have built up from you play during the opening chapter.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: As soon as you enter Garamsythe Waterway: East Waterway Control, there is a map urn at the dead end to the left.

**New and Exciting Ways to Kill a Man** (Challenge): Our first real boss and challenge! When you reach Garamsythe Waterway: Central Waterway Control, turn off all gambits on all characters, including your guest, and then make use of the Save Crystal. The battle does not present a primed achievement indicator unfortunately. Once ready, enter the door to the north to the boss fight against Firemane. It's time to mostly fight like a traditional turn-based RPG.
- Cue up commands as they are being executed by a character. Attack will be your most frequent, for sure, but that command will auto-queue after use. If you happen to have a Water Mote, this might be a great opportunity to make use of it. If anyone has access to Blind, that can be helpful as well. As Attack commands continue, be ready to use items or Cure spells to heal up.
- When Firemane teleports, your characters will sometimes stop their actions. Find the boss to continue the battle, requeuing your Attacks, other methods of dealing damage, or do more healing.
- Want to do even MORE damage? Lure Firemane into the water on the ground in the area. Your attacks will be more effective while the water terrain effect is in place on Firemane. Thunder spells will be more effective too, though attacks should be more than enough for you.
- Firemane has HP thresholds that will trigger it's use of the Bushfire skill: 80%, 50%, and 20%. Be ready to heal up as you reach these points on the boss' health bar. Also, remove poison status with Antidotes if that lands during the Bushfire (though it seems the chance of that happening is low).
- It's probably not worth trying to steal from this boss. You are more than likely to get a Potion or Phoenix Down rather than the 3% rare steal of a Grimoire Togail. While the grimoire is needed for a bazaar item, you'll be able to get them later on.
- After you win and the scenes play out, don't forget to turn your gambits back on as characters rejoin the party!

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: After defeating the three Seeq bullies in Nalbina Dungeon: The Arena and the scenes, you'll be in Confiscatory, where you'll get your equipment back as well as the map of the location.

**Hold All the Cards** (Characters?): Once in Barheim Passage: The Lightworks, you'll find your first merchant that sells gambits. Convenient! Even better, there is a guaranteed chest that contains 2510 gil in the alcove to the right from where you first appear in the area. Buying all available gambits from the merchant costs 2000 gil. Even more convenient! These gambits will be available at other gambit shops and merchants so you certainly don't have to get them all now, but it certainly can't hurt and you probably have more than enough money to spare at this point. You probably have a lot of loot to sell as well. The journey to getting all of the gambits begins!
- Regarding getting ALL of the gambits, once the rest of them are accessible after escaping from Barheim Passage, you'll see prices range from 50-500 gil per gambit.
- Ideally, you'll want to focus on getting those that will see the most use in these beginning chapters. Don't sweat purchasing more than you need, or the rest of them, until you have too much money to know what to do with it all. This can be a late game/post game unlock.
- **Total number of gambits:** 249
- **Total cost:** 27,410 gil

**Arrive To the Mist** (Characters): This can be unlocked at any time when a character has a job license board, but I got my first one in Barheim Passage.

**Keep On the Lights** (Challenge): This starts as soon as you put in the Tube Fuse you receive from Burrogh, the merchant, into the Power Relay (initially called "Timeworn Device"). Burrogh will only give you the Tube Fuse if you first looked at the Timeworn Device. For safety, make sure you save prior to inserting the fuse so that you can retry if the power level drops below 25%.
- Once progressing through the passage, keep an eye out for Battery Mimics. These fiends will drain the Charge so they are a priority. You have your introduction to them in the very next zone: Op Sector 29. There will be a pair of them and the charge drains to 30% right away! Yikes! Take out the one draining the cables as soon as possible. In my first attempt, I was able to keep power at 27% and beat it to restore power considerably. Even just attacking it to aggro it is helpful to keep the power charge from continuing to tick down. Once the charged up Battery Mimic is dead, the charge will restore. In my second attempt (after forgetting about the one session restriction), I failed to keep it above 25%. I assume this was because the other Battery Mimic reached their conduit to drain before I could get there. So I had to reset and try yet again. I tried again to put some pressure on the second mimic before it could run downstairs but it eventually broke away and I was not able to beat the first one in time. Focus all characters on the first mimic for success. This is probably the hardest part of the challenge. If you continue to have trouble, think about making use of motes or any spells available. When I finally succeeded, I used some Dark Motes on both Battery Mimics with multiple characters to quickly take them down. If the second Battery Mimic gets away, it will run downstairs to chomp on another cable and drain power again. The game provides a notification when this happens. You should have more buffer after taking out the first one to finish up attacking the small fry before fighting the big Mimic.
- The very next zone, Great Eastern Passage, has a Battery Mimic to quickly eliminate. At the fork, take the right path to find another Battery Mimic. Double pack and take the left path. At the next fork, continue to the left for one more Battery Mimic. Head back to the fork and take the right path. You'll come to a point where two paths merge, where the path you haven't explored yet has the map urn.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: The Barheim Passage map is located in the map urn in Great Eastern Passage, in a passage to the north after making it through the forked paths with Battery Mimics.

**Keep On the Lights (cont'd)**: Proceed south from the map urn to one more Battery Mimic that enters the area from the southern exit. Take it out. Getting through these areas while knowing where the Mimics will be makes it quite easy to keep the power charge high and even topped up at 100%. Fighting the mimics is important to help boost up your charge level if it has dropped down. Here are the other locations and where the Battery Mimics can be found:
- Op Sector 36: An optional area accessible from the platform at the southern end of the Great Eastern Passage. There are two Battery Mimics here along with treasures. The first is to your right upon entering the zone and the second is down the stairs.
- Special Op Sector 3: You'll arrive here from the southern exit of the Great Eastern Passage. As you continue south, a Battery Mimic will appear from the right and run south toward more cables to chew. Return to wear it came from to find Flans blocking the path to another Battery Mimic. Use Fire to eliminate the Flans quickly then get to the Battery Mimic.
- Op Sector 37: This area contains the switch that will open the gate blocking progress through Barheim Passage. It is up the stairs from the second Battery Mimic in Special Op Sector 3. A mimic is to your left upon entering the first room of the zone. You may see a second downstairs run off as you fight the first one. Chase after it, fending off any Flans along the way and defeat it to stop the drain on the power charge. Loot treasures and then press the Gate Switchboard's button. Note that this will drain 30% charge. If your charge dropped too low before hitting the switch, you'll need to start over from your save. Return to Special Op Sector 3.
- North-South Junction: Feel free to use the Save Crystal here after the cutscenes but don't save over your slot from prior to attempting this achievement.
- Great Central Passage: Head south and check the alcove to your left for a Battery Mimic which presents a perfect opportunity to get your power charge back up again. This is the point where Mimics with do the traditional thing of pretending to be treasure chests as well.
- The Zeviah Subterrane: As soon as you enter, you'll find two Battery Mimics. One will fight you and the other will run off. This is a large area so use your map to see the glowing <!> areas that identify where the Battery Mimics will be. You are nearly at the end of this challenge!
- Terminus No. 4 Adjunct: Another Save Crystal just before an arena room. Boss fight incoming!
- Mimic Queen fight: The big issue here is balancing your attacks on the queen while also dealing with the Tiny Batteries that are draining the power charge. I used Vaan to eliminate Tiny Batteries while the others focused on the Queen. I was able to outpace its healing and spawning replacements easily. The achievement unlocks upon defeat of the Mimic Queen, as long as the power was maintained above 25% in the entire session.

**A Shocking Escape** (Challenge): When nearing the end of Barheim Passage and at the Save Crystal in the Terminus No. 4 Adjunct zone, remove Balthier and Fran from the party. You have the potential of doing this AND **Keep On the Lights** together. I was not able to because I was worried about the reaction the Mimic Queen has to killing the Tiny Batteries (it heals itself and then spawns a replacement), and that the Tiny Batteries are gnawing on cables draining the power while you focus on the Mimic Queen trying to avoid that healing reaction. I did a test after unlocking this achievement and found that I was able to succeed in keeping the charge above 25% while only having my Monk Vaan and the Guest. I would have Guest focus on the Queen while I directed Vaan manually to attack a Tiny Battery until it died. I then moved Vaan to the next one, keeping the pressure on taking out these Tiny Batteries. I was able to outpace the healing and spawning of replacements and then it seemed that Queen stopped spawning new ones once its health was lower. With that in mind, I recommend not doing this until AFTER completing **Keep On the Lights** since that requires completing in one session. With my Vaan at level 9 and the Guest at level 11, setting up gambits so that Vaan and Guest focused on the foe with the highest HP and healing an ally that goes less that 50% with a Potion, I had no issue getting this. Of course, your experience may vary depending on your selected job for Vaan and that may even impact being able to do both this and **Keep On the Lights**. Good luck!
- **New level cap**: The next boss must be defeated at or under level 15. If you are like me, your party average is probably around 10 at this point.
- ***TODO***: Fix up the above to make it read better, but I did capture everything about being able to beat this AND do **Keep On the Lights** together. The big thing to remember is that the ability to do both may be dependent on the job assigned to Vaan. Worst case, make a save, prioritize finishing **Keep On the Lights**, then reload the save and do this achievement after word.

**Sister's Path** (Side Quest): This is a missable achievement because the responses given will determine the reward which could lock you out of getting the required Runeblade. You can start this quest as soon as you return to Rabanastre after the Mimic Queen fight. Ktjn, a Viera, will ask you questions throughout the progress of the story and you'll want to respond appropriately to get the best award. She will be found in Muthru Bazaar sitting on the stair railing leading up to North End. Talk to her twice to get her first question. It beings with "Is the city not wonderful?" and ends with "Should this not trouble me as a viera?" Respond with "Yes, you should be ashamed" to set you on the path toward the Runeblade. Seems like an awful thing to say though...

**Game Breaker** (Challenge? Treasure?): This is the earliest point in which the Seitengrat is available to find. The Aerodrome is now open with flights going to Nalbina. This bow is ridiculously overpowered, is in a chest that is invisible, and the contents of the invisible chest can rarely be the weapon. The power of the bow and the lack of requirement to have a license to equip it is why it is excluded for most of the boss challenges. It does NOT seem to be prevented for use in hunts, however...
- Obtaining it easily requires immense luck or RNG manipulation. RA's Agnam has a video that shows how to obtain it with consistency. It's wild! The volume on it is very low so you'll need to turn it up. Also, it requires starting from the Bhujerba Aerodrome, so we'll wait to get it once we're there.

**Hold All the Cards (cont'd)**: All gambits should now be available in the gambit shop in Rabanastre. They are much more expensive at this point so you won't be able to get them all now, more than likely. Just pick up what you need for now. You'll be able to get the rest as you please throughout the game.

### She Airship Enough For You ➡️ Proof of Royal Lineage

***Level Cap Reminder***: Next level cap is 15 for the boss fight in the Lhusu Mines! Note that your guest character's level in this dungeon is not applicable (they leave before the fight).

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: After arriving in Bhujerba, you'll find a Teleport Save Crystal nearby. Interact with it to add it to the list. Because of the urgency of the visit here, you can't use it to teleport right now anyway.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: You'll find a Cartographer's Guild moogle at the top of the stairs on the path leading away from the Aerodrome. You can buy maps of Bhujerba and Lhusu Mines for them to complete these areas for 720 gil.

**Show Off I and II (cont'd)**: As you head through the Lhusu Mines and pass through Oltam Span, you have a 20% chance of encountering Aerieel, a rare game version of the Steeling that spawn here. Feel free to defeat it if it shows up as it is fairly easy to defeat despite the level 16 cap for the **I Will Have My Pound of Flesh** challenge. Of course, after doing that challenge, the cap will raise to 22 so you have even more room if you have some difficulty. In any case, just have everyone attack the Aerieel and it will drop fairly quickly.

**The Unrelenting** (Sky Pirate's Den): In the Lhusu Mines is a popular location to rack up chain and unlock Montblanc's statue in the Sky Pirate's Den. If you are too close to the level cap, definitely hold off on this. At Lhusu Mines: Shunia Twinspan are a ton of Skeletons and Skull Defenders. You can very quickly reach a 50-chain in the location by slowly going through to encourage these enemies to spawn, fighting them to build chain, and running up and down the span to encourage as many enemies as possible to spawn. When finished, run back two zones to Oltam Span and back to Shunia Twinspan to respawn the enemies and do it again. Just make sure to hold R2 for Escaping Mode so that you avoid any enemies that may have respawned in Transitway 1. This is a great spot to quickly get license points too, if you need them. Just make sure you have someone keeping Libra up so that you can identify traps.
- As a metric, I was level 10 on average when going into this zone. I was level 12 average when I unlocked **The Unrelenting**.

**Blood Dancer** (Sky Pirate's Den): There is a good chance that you could get Basch's statue while working on the 50-chain as well. If not, you are probably really close unless you've been keeping your levels really low. Nevertheless, this one will come naturally over the course of the game anyway.

**I Will Have My Pound of Flesh** (Challenge): If you are interested in collecting the treasures in this area, such as the Assassin's Dagger if you have a Hunter, make sure to get them before going to the boss fight. Once Ba'Gamnan is defeated, the chests permanently despawn in Site 2. Okay, as for strategy, make sure to keep your health up. Modify your gambits if you need to to have one character focused on healing while the other two fight the henchmen first before fighting Ba'Gamnan. I'd focus on Gijuk first, since they're hasted at the start of the battle and is the opposing party's spellcaster. Then take out Bwagi and Rinok. Finally knock out Ba'Gamnan. If you have any quickening available at this point, this is a great time to bust them out to help reduce their numbers and HP. If you chain a few or more, you'll certainly get at least Inferno as the Area of Effect followup. Just keep an eye on HP and ensure gambits are throwing Potions if anyone gets too low or you are manually doing so. If you have mages, expect Ba'Gamnan and lackeys to silence them so a White Mage character may lose their ability to cast Cure. Use Echo Herbs as needed to recover from that as well. Also, don't forget the Motes you've no doubt accumulated! This gang of Bangaa are weak to water but Dark Motes could also be of help. Your Black or Red Mage could have the Water spell from the Bhujerba magick shop and their license is unlocked. If you have a Dispel Mote, you could remove the buffs on one of them as well (preferably Ba'Gamnan). You don't have to worry about gaining levels during this fight as the bosses do not give XP, only LP.
- What I did: I set gambits to have Vaan and Basch use Potions when anyone was less that 50% HP while Balthier would cast Cure when anyone was less that 70% HP. Vaan would target the foe with the lowest HP (which would be the lackeys, especially after using Quickenings) while the others targeted Vaan's target as the party leader. One other gambit I put on Basch was using Hi-Potions when an ally went below 30% HP, as a backup to curing in an emergency. My party was an average of level 12. I focused my Quickening on Gijuk first to take him out and drop the HP of the other two lackeys. If you are quick, you could potential hit Ba'Gamnan with the followup area of effect as well to get a start on knocking down his HP! Rinok was my next target because their Jump attack is pretty damaging at this low level. Once you have two down, the fight becomes much more manageable. I was probably making the fight a bit more difficult by having Balthier in my party since the bangaa like to focus on him, but it worked out in the end.
- **New level cap**: The next boss must be defeated at level 22 or less. Keep in mind that you will have a guest join for the boss that will be at a higher level than the party (average level of the two highest level characters + 4 levels).

**Raise a Clamor** (Challenge): Fun... this starts right as you leave the mines. There is opportunity to save, but make it quick! There is no timer shown, only the primed achievement indicator. If you need to pause and figure out a path, use the emulator's pause function to halt things. Note that using L1 to speed up the game does not increase the speed of the timer (I assume the achievement logic is using the in-game timer to determine if 100 seconds has elapsed). However, I'd recommend only using that when walking a straight line and be ready to turn it off if you need finer control of your movement. The best people to press the Square button next to are the City Parijanah (the people with the blue books in their hands that help you learn about the city).
- To accomplish this, I used [RedrumOverdose](https://retroachievements.org/user/RedrumOverdose)'s route for the most part as well as the recommendation to use the save to take my time to learn the route before executing it again while in double speed mode. Use the [maps](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1292596668) to learn the names and layouts of the streets that you'll be running through as well.
- As soon as you start, press square near the shopkeeper by the exit of Lhusu Square, then head out the exit to Miner's End.
- At the Y intersection, press Square at the Parijanah that is at the center point of the Y. Then run out the other end of the Y that leads to the Cloudborne Row zone.
- This is a great spot to double speed. Run through Cloudborne Row to the intersection, take the north route to another intersection where another Parijanah awaits. I was at around 59% at this point. Head east and loop around to near the ramp that leads out of the zone for yet another Parijanah, putting me up to 71%.
- The next zone is Travica Way, and you'll come up behind the Cartographer's Guild moogle from when you first arrived in Bhujerba, along with another Parijanah. If you were quick and are close to both of these NPCs, pressing Square here will get you to 100%. If you still need a little bit more, quickly head south to the weapon shop entrance when one more Parijanah waits to get that final push.
- Some potential pitfalls:
  - When entering a new zone, it may take a bit for NPCs to load. Make sure you aren't standing where they will appear or they won't load in until you move away.
  - While in double speed, the meter will drop quicker than with it off. Only use double speed when you can make quick, straight movements or you have the path more or less memorized.
  - I experienced an instance near the end where pressing Square started a conversation with an NPC rather than cause Vaan to shout. This was because the meter for the interaction hadn't loaded in yet. I'm not playing with Fast CDVD Loading on so maybe that was why it happened. If it happens to you, quickly press the Circle button to get out of the conversation and press Square again to shout.

**The Sky Sisters** (Side Quest): If you want to do the Seitengrat RNG manipulation, you'll need to have at least traveled in the passenger airships at least once as there is a cutscene that will play when you first board one that can affect your RNG position. So, this is a perfect time to kick off the Sky Sisters quest. To do so, board one of the flights and go speak to the Chief Steward. If it is Ann, she'll be hounded by a person named Rande, who seems to think you are some sort of rival love interest. This can be started at any time and you can't finish the quest yet, but if you are going for the Seitengrat, you may as well kick this off while trying to get past the initial flight cutscene.

**Game Breaker (cont'd)**: The Bhujerba Aerodrome is now open for business. If you want to go for the Seitengrat, this is the best opportunity to do so, based on the video created by [Agnam](https://retroachievements.org/user/Agnam). You can also check out [a video by Roostalol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyjzj_cN6Ic) that provides a bit more context on how this RNG manipulation works. Good luck and may the RNG be in your favor, manipulated or otherwise.
- Again, reminder that the volume for the Agnam's explanation is quite low, so make sure to turn your volume back down once you have listened to their explanation and try it out in-game. Roostalol is much louder so if you are having a hard time, use that video instead.
- Get the [RNG Helper application](https://github.com/blakehartley/RNGHelper) that is shown in the video. Unfortunately, this may be only for Windows systems. Hopefully there is a similar application out there for other platforms or this one may already work in Linux (Android devices might be out of luck unless someone ports it over some day or you have a PC or something that can run it...).
- Have a save file from the prologue with Reks and a file at Bhujerba Aerodrome. Your save at Bhujerba Aerodrome should have done at least one passenger flight already to avoid the unskippable cutscene that will play once you are on your maiden voyage.
- By default, the Character Stats section is already filled out with Reks' stats. Double check it. If it is different, update the values in the RNG Helper application, close the game and restart it, loading the Reks save one more time.
- Ensure your Chest 1 settings are as follows:
  - Appears Chance: 1
  - RNG Position: 154
  - Gil Chance: 80
  - Item 1 Chance: 95
  - Gil Amount: 100
- Set the "Consume" text box to 11.
- The overall goal is to get your RNG position to 544. You advance the RNG position by one when you cast Cure. You advance the position by 11 when you attack yourself (called "Consume" in RNG Helper).
- I am assuming that you are using PCSX2. I'm not familiar with other PS2 emulators and can't speak to their experience.
- If you have the game open, close it. You should be at PCSX2's game selection screen. Start up Final Fantasy XII: IZJS and load your Reks save that I told you to keep.
- Tell Reks to cast Cure on himself. Record the value of HP restored in the "Last heal" text box and press the Start button on RNG Helper.
- For continued casts of Cure, update the value of HP restored in "Last heal" if it doesn't match and press the Continue button.
- As you press Continue, the RNG position table will update to where it thinks you are at based on the Cure values you provide it. If you are far away from RNG position 544, have Reks attack himself and press the Consume button for each successful attack to advance the position by 11 spots. If I got a combo hit or a block, that seemed to mess up my RNG position and I needed to start the search over again. I wouldn't reset the whole thing, I'd just use the new unexpected heal value and press the Start button to start a new search. Make use of the Save Crystal as needed to restore HP and MP as you do this. Once you think you have your RNG position confirmed, use Cure again to verify that the number of HP gained matches what is shown in the "Last heal" text box.
- If you have Reks attack himself when the "Combo after punch #" value says "0", Reks will combo himself and either die or throw off your RNG position. So if you see a 0 there, use Cure magic to get past that RNG position rather than attack.
  - One funny bit in Agnam's video is when Reks combos himself. If that happens to you, unfortunately you'll have to start over again. I hope that is a rare occurrence and Agnam's reaction suggests that it is.
  - Having Fast CDVD Loading on seems to affect the starting RNG position. If your starting position is above 544, toggle your Fast CDVD Loading setting in PCSX2 and try again.
  - In my own personal struggles with this, I was constantly finding Reks blocking after a chain of cures and attacks which would completely throw off my RNG tracking because I don't know how much a block consumes, but it DOES consume because my Cure values would no longer be tracking the same. So, after starting with Cures to find my starting position, I would have Reks attack himself for as long as I could, using the Save Crystal when health got low enough, until I got close to the 544 position or the "Combo after punch #" value said "0". Then I would Cure the rest of the way.
- The green rows on the table are the RNG positions used. So, you are looking for the last green row to be Position 544, meaning that the very next position will be 545, which is what will net you the Seitengrat.
- Once at the correct position, pause the game by pressing Start on your controller and Quit to Title by pressing the Square button and confirming.
- Now you will be loading your Aerodrome save and performing specific actions quickly. I will leave that part to the videos so you can see how Agnam positions Vaan and the quickness of the actions. It'd be hard to explain here in text, but I will try. If it doesn't work, practice makes perfect. Try to mimic the actions in the videos and then try again if it doesn't work.
  - As soon as select your Bhujerba Aerodrome save, hold up-left on the stick to run toward the desk where the Flights to Rabanastre attendant will load in. Stand slightly away from the desk so that the attendant will actually load (too close and they won't appear).
  - Turn the camera so that you are looking back at the Teleport Save Crystal, the attendant's desk to your left, and the center of the walkway. As soon as the City Parijanah loads in the center of the path, pause the game for about 10 seconds or so (some say 3-4 seconds, I paused longer) to ensure that the attendant loaded in.
  - Hold the left stick in the direction of the desk, unpause, and spam the Circle button until your flight is confirmed and the screen goes black.
  - Quickly skip the cutscene of the airship departing.
  - Continue to mash Circle while holding up on the left stick as the Chief Steward talks to you over a black screen.
  - As the scene on the sky ferry's Observation Parlor comes into view, you'll be moving up the stairs. Take a left and continue up the next step of stairs, turning the camera to follow behind Vaan.
  - Once against the door that leads outside to the Air Deck, continue walking forward and press Circle to open the door on the second step. This delay to open the door is critical to ensuring that the invisible chest appears.
  - Hold up-left on the left stick to go around the wall to get to some stairs. Head up the stairs long the center and keep walking until you, hopefully, run into an invisible chest.
  - Position Vaan next to the chest and equip the Diamond Armlet if not already equipped.
  - Begin to observe two NPCs: a person walking around in a green tank top, and a person walking up and down the stairs you just climbed that is in red and black clothes. The behavior of these NPCs will help you time opening the invisible chest to guarantee the Seitengrat:
    - The red NPC must go up and down the stairs twice. When they descend the second time, now you will keep your eyes on the green NPC.
    - The green NPC will come to a stop of the lower right corner of the emblem on the ground. They will then turn away from you and walk toward the upper right corner of the emblem. On that NPC's 3rd step, press Circle to open the invisible chest. That should be your Seitengrat! Have fun breaking the game, if you wish.
- One thing to not forget (which I kept forgetting...) is that you make sure Vaan has the Diamond Armlet equipped. You can do this on the ferry airship while standing next to the chest if you wish. If you don't equip it, the chest will spawn but it will give you a Knot of Rust instead.
- Finally, once you have obtained Seitengrat, you will have one of the four items toward the **Zodiac's Hidden Gifts** achievement.

**The Cry of Its Power/No One Likes My Pets, Kupo...** (Hunts/Side Quest): If you got the Rocktoise quest from Montblanc, you can find Pilika in Bhujerba: Skygrounds to accept the quest. If your levels are low, especially for the Ba'Gamnan level cap, it may be a bit tough to defeat this right away. You could grind a bit in Lhusu Mines as you make your way toward Site 2 for the hunt, but keep the next level cap of 22 in mind and that you will have some fights coming up after your meeting with the Marquis. Rocktoise is level 16, so around there should be a good target.
- General strategy:
  - Set up a traditional party composition of tank, DPS, and healer. A White or Red Mage can serve well as healer casting Cure or Cura with its area of effect, or just someone set up to chuck Potions like crazy. The tank will provide backup on healing with Potions and should be your character with the most HP, such as a Knight character. Finally, your DPS, the main damage dealer, should be your fastest character, such as Vaan as a Hunter or Monk who can attack multiple times per round. Any combination will work though and feel free to experiment.
  - Get the tank up to Rocktoise as the primary attack to draw its aggro toward the tank. Meanwhile, your healer's gambits should be set up for them to be slinging cure spells or Potions/Hi-Potions frequently. The healer should also be prepared to recover any status effects on the party (if you don't have gambit slots, just issue the commands manually). Finally, your DPS will be primarily attacking with their gambit setup, typically by targeting the foe the tank/party leader is attacking.
  - Rocktoise will start increasing its attack frequency when around 30-20% HP remaining. This is a perfect time to unleash quickenings to deplete the remaining health.
- Once defeated, return to Pilika to get your reward and complete the hunt, awarding **The Cry of Its Power**. Talk to the moogle again to start the side quest, where they hand you a Merchant's Armband. No matter what you decide to do while retrieving the diary they ask you to get, respond with "I've done nothing." to Pilika to get the better prize and the **No One Likes My Pets, Kupo...** achievement.

**Marauder in the Mines** (Hunts): You can also take this hunt on as you head into the mines to defeat the Rocktoise if you wish. Talk to Aekom near the mine entrance to start the hunt.
- Nidhogg will be at Lhusu Mines: Transitway 1 near the main split path. You'll probably see the giant blue snake as soon as you enter the zone. Using the Tank, DPS, Healer combo will continue to aid you here. Note that the healer may have trouble keeping up with Cure spells if that is all that's available so supplement by the tank using Hi-Potions or Potions. It's also a good idea to have a gambit for treating poison, though if you don't have the slots available, feel free to manually use Antidotes.
- Nidhogg is weak to Fire! You probably have the Fire spell, AND you may even have the Oil spell! Make use of that weakness and the 3x damage boost from Oil.
- As with other hunt monsters, Nidhogg will increase attack frequency, physical power, physical defense, and speed as it's HP gets low.
- After your victory and talking to Aekom again, the Seeq will give you a Great Serpentskin. This item is needed for the **Covered Up In Flowers/Treasure Hunter Mog** quests! DO NOT SELL IT!!!

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: After going to see the Marquis and a bunch of cutscenes, you'll be onboard the Leviathan, receiving the map of the area.

**Spellsinger** (Sky Pirate's Den): I unlocked it while onboard Dreadnought Leviathan but you mileage will vary depending on how much you are using spells.

### Proof of Royal Lineage ➡️ Power of Dawn

***Level Cap Reminder***: Level 22 for the next boss. You will have a guest and they will join at a higher level than you (average level of the two highest level characters + 4 levels).

**Tale of the Forgotten Grimoire** (Inventory? Side Quest?): When you buy your first Forgotten Grimoire from the bazaar, this will unlock. I happened to buy my first one after doing a bit of grinding of skeletons in the Lhusu Mines after the events on the Dreadnought Leviathan and selling the loot. 

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: After checking in with the Marquis and the cutscenes that follow, you'll be at Dalmasca Westersand: The Western Divide. Touch the Teleport Save Crystal to register a new teleport spot.

**Sister's Path (cont'd)**: After leaving Bhujerba finally, ready to head to Raithwall's Tomb, you can return to Rabanastre to respond to the next thing  discusses. To stay on the path toward the Runeblade, when Ktjn says, "I knew my choice would bring hardship, yet...", respond with "You should've thought it through."

**Of the Highest Grade!** (Side Quest): I hadn't done the Cluckatrice hunt yet so I made my way back to Giza Plains and the giant dusk crystals were shining again. Talking to Masyua will let you charge up a new sunstone. All you need to do is go around to the shining dusk crystals again (marked on your map as well). When you charge your sunstone, the dusk crystal goes dark and the opposite crystal on the other side of the plains will light up. You can either circle around the zones to charge your sunstone to 100%, or you can go back and forth between two alternating stones. Either way, once at 100%, return to Masyua again and give the sunstone to her to get the reward and the achievement. As the description states, make sure you have the room for the reward. I assume this is due to how the set developer determined that the sunstone was fully charged.

**Little Love on the Big Plains** (Hunts): The Cluckatrice and its three Chickatrices are a tough fight at lower levels. I waited until after Bhujerba so that I could have higher levels, better weapons and armor, and more skills to work with before the fight. To get the mark to appear, you must clear out all of the fiends in Giza Plains: Gizas North Bank. Once done, leave the zone (if you go back to the village you can save just before hand) and return to find one of the Chickatrices. If you attack it, the Cluckatrice and other chicks will join in on the fight!
- First thing prior to engaging is to ensure that you have adequate defenses on your tank and make sure that they engage first. If you are using a spellcaster, make sure that you don't use Aero type spells if you have them. They are weak to Earth spells, but you may not have them this early. With all of these enemies, expect to be taking a ton of damage quickly. Make sure you have a dedicated healer.
- Quickenings can be very useful. Once all of the marks are gathered around, let loose! I would recommend targeting the Cluckatrice since it has the most HP. Getting a decent chain could nearly or completely take it out and do decent damage to the chicks to make wiping them up easy.
- The Cluckatrice can cause a variety of status ailments. If you have unlocked Remedy Lore licenses, you probably have a few vials of Remedy by now to clear up Petrify or Slow statuses.
- The Cluckatrice will attack much more quickly at less than 20% health so if the quickenings and follow up Concurrence doesn't eliminate it, finish the job quickly.
- Of course, you may have Seitengrat by now as well. I won't mention it any more after this, but there is no restriction for using it with the Hunts. So, feel free to go wild with it, I guess. 🤷‍♂️
- After turning in the hunt results and getting the reward (and achievement), sell the Rainbow Egg to unlock a Hi-Potion Pack in the bazaar. A worthy investment!

**Waterway Haunting** (Hunts): After returning to The Sandsea and getting the job for the Wyvern Lord before heading toward Raithwall's Tomb, I noticed I forgot to get the Wraith hunt done. So, I went to knock that out quickly while I was in the area as well.
- You''ll find the petitioner Milha in Lowtown: North Sprawl hunched down by a door to a Residence. Talk to them to start the hunt.
- In Lowtown's Storeroom 5, take the east door down to Garamsythe Waterway: Overflow Cloaca to find the Wraith. Watch out for status effects, use Fire or Thunder if available, and use traditional tank, healer, DPS roles to easily take this mark down. The particular status it will use the most is Doom but it has a chance of missing your party, especially if you decide to do this at a higher level like I did. Counter Doom by reviving anyone that dies from it and cycle your characters if you need to in order to make sure at least someone is alive if Phoenix Downs or the Raise spell are somehow not available.
- Head back to Lowtown and talk to Milha again to get your reward, complete the hunt, and get the achievement.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: After the cutscene upon entering Ogir-Yensa Sandsea, you'll find two map urns at the top of the ramp to the first platform.

**Show Off I and II (cont'd)**: The rare game Pineapple has a 20% chance of spawning in Ogir-Yensa Sandsea: Platform 1 - Refinery. If you happen to come across it, you should be able to defeat it without too much issue but it may be better to come back later on to avoid getting levels too high grinding for it at this time. 
- Additionally, the Urutan Exile appears in Platform 2 - Refinery if you have a 100 kills of Urutan-Yensa enemies without leaving the Ogir-Yensa region or touching a Save Crystal! This will definitely net you a ton of experience so if you have a gap in levels until reaching the level 22 cap, you might want to try for this as well. Just keep an eye on your levels, especially Vossler, and use Firefly accessories if needed or wait until later on.
  - Going for this rare game now, despite the level 22 cap for the upcoming boss, is probably a good idea as it will help you get your levels closer to the cap so that you have better chances of winning the fight and the grind of 100 enemies will be more convenient to do now.
  - Chain isn't required, but it can certainly help in keeping track of the number as well as ensuring you meet the requirements of not touching a Save Crystal or leaving the region.
    - If you do have the max chain level before the fight, you'll have a higher chance of the Urutan Exile dropping the Magoroku katana, which is much more powerful at this point of the game than other weapons currently available (18% chance versus 5% with no chain).
  - The Primary Tank Complex zone will probably be the ideal location to build up chain on Urutan-Yensa. Just be cautious of the Salamand Entite that likes to roam around the center platforms. Turn off spell gambits around it!
- After all the Urutan-Yensa grinding, I got dangerously close to exceeding level 22 on Vossler. Be wary of your guest characters!!

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: Another Teleport Save Crystal can be found at Ogir-Yensa Sandsea: Yensa Border Tunnel in the southwest corner of the region.

**Plunderer** (Sky Pirate's Den): When you unlock this achievement and the Penelo statue in the Den will undoubtedly vary but selling loot and finding chests with gil will get you to 100,000 gil accumulated over the course of the game easily. Note that you do NOT need to have that amount on hand all at once. The game tracks how much you have earned.

**Covered Up In Mist** (Characters?): Another achievement that can be unlocked at varying times for different people based on their progression through the License Board. I got my achievement with Vaan's Monk board while opening paths to the Phoenix Lore and White Magic 9 licenses, along with the cheap spot to the right of the starting point. Ideally, you will want to maximize license board slots exposed so when unlocking quickenings rather than just grabbing the first three slots along the way. Pace yourself to ensure you are unable to unlock the most potential licenses on your characters' boards.

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: Touch the Teleport Save Crystal after defeating Garuda to register this new teleport spot.

**Better Decide Fast** (Challenge): You must get to Raithwall's Tomb with all characters, including your guest, at level 22 or less. If you do have Seitengrat, do not use it, of course.
- This is associated with the first Demon Wall you encounter. Not the other one that you'd fight if you run from the first. Note that the primed achievement indicator will appear if you meet the requirements as soon as you use the teleport way stone to enter the interior of the tomb.
- Probably the biggest key to doing this fight quickly enough is Vossler. Use his Expose technick to lower the Demon Wall's defense. I would save Traveler for the next boss fight.
- You may not have Holy, which is Demon Wall's weakness, but it is susceptible to Oil and combining that with Fire spells will do some damage as well (as long as it didn't spawn with Reflect, which it has a 50% chance of doing).
- Quickenings will also be a great tool of course, though having more slots unlocked will do more to make this faster. If all of your party members have mist slots, rotate out the standby party to throw out their quickenings as well if you need.
- This Demon Wall can use the spell Telega after it takes four actions. This will banish one random character for the remainder of the fight. Make use of the quickenings prior to this happening. Rotate in new party members to replace those banished as needed.
- Demon Wall will also use Annul on the party member with the most MP, which will likely be a magic user. If you are trying to use Fire on an Oil-soaked Demon Wall, that form of DPS will be lost unless you have Ethers. It'll occasionally Silence magic casting characters as well.
- Raising the battle speed to the fastest setting will ensure more attacks by your party (as well as Demon Wall) but the enemy will still move forward at the same speed.
- I was able to defeat the boss before it reached the third set of torches by hitting the boss with Expose, using quickenings with Basch, Fran, and Balthier, continuing to attack until the first Telega was cast (which eliminated Vossler), and then swapping to Vaan, Penelo, and Ashe to chain their quickenings. With both sets of quickenings, I hit 10+ chain and had the Torrent concurrence. Luck obviously plays a role in getting Mist Charges during the chain so be ready with that R2 button to shuffle and get new Mist Charges during the chain to keep it going. I didn't have my battle speed turned up (it was at the default) because I didn't think of it until after the fact. My wall spawned with Reflect so I didn't notice it until I cast Oil and it reflected onto Basch so I was forced into using only physical attacks and the quickenings.
- **New level cap**: Level 25 for two bosses. Both bosses are not too far off... The big problem here is that Vossler is in your party and cannot be put on the bench so if he was close to or at level 22 at the Demon Wall, he could potentially hit level 25 by the required fight. He may not exceed it, but it could be a close call. Keep an eye on his XP in the Status screen and maybe knock him out if he hits level 25.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: After defeating the second Demon Wall and the cutscene that follows in the Royal Passage zone, you'll find a map urn near three Way Stones.

**Show Off I and II (cont'd)**: In the Royal Passage is a rare game called Barmuu that will appear near the map urn if you chain 12 enemies (easiest would be the Seekers in the area). You should be able to achieve this chain while running back and forth picking up the guaranteed chests with the Dispel and Vanish magicks.

**Show Off I and II (cont'd)**: Meanwhile, in the Southfall Passage zone, a Cultsworn Lich has a chance of spawning when a Lich divides at critical health. If you don't encounter it now while traveling through the area, perhaps hold off to find it until later on when level caps are no longer a concern.

**Beast My Guest** (Challenge): An interesting challenge idea here. Fight the Esper with only Vossler and all gambits off while the main party members can only throw Potions to heal up. When you enter the Cloister of Flame, you'll have a cutscene about the concentration of Mist in the area. If you don't see the primed achievement indicator, leave the room, turn off gambits on everyone (including Vossler), and reenter the room to ensure the indicator is on prior to the fight. Since gambits are off, you'll be manually managing everything, just like with Firemane.
- Just like with the optional Demon Wall, Vossler's technicks are the key to this fight. Use Wither and Expose to lower Belias' strength and defense and should be used immediately. If you haven't made use of Traveler yet, use it now to take out a ton of HP (or save it for just before 50% HP to take out the rest of it without dealing with Belias' additional abilities later). If you did use Traveler run some laps around the Cloister of Flame while in double speed to quickly get more steps. Otherwise, just attack physically! You can use the Scathe Mote (or any other attack items) that you got from defeating the optional Demon Wall as well. If you happen to have a Hastega Mote, that could be a boon for you as well.
- The second half of the fight is kicked off by Belias using the Greater Barrier skill to reduce damage it takes followed by Firaja which will do around 300-400 HP to all characters and possibly add the Oil status. If Vossler gets Oil, make sure he uses a Handkerchief to remove it or the follow up Fire spells from Belias will quickly drop his HP.
- If you need to swap out party members for some reason, make sure to ADD a party member before removing! The achievement tracks if you have less that 3 party members in action, even while in the menu, and will disable the achievement if that happens.
- Since the other party members can only use Potions, throw them judiciously at Vossler to keep him alive. Before the fight, look at your license board and unlock any Potion Lore licenses for your jobs if available to help increase their effectiveness. Make sure you have a full stock of Potions as well! Leave the tomb to restock if necessary. Party members can die freely and then you can swap in new one to keep the Potions flowing, just be careful doing so as described above. I had 89 in my inventory before the fight but I left to go save and get the remaining 10, just in case. Dyce, the merchant you meet in the Sandsea will be at the tomb's entrance to buy more supplies. By the end of the fight, I had used 55 Potions.
- Keeping your other party members alive to throw potions is secondary, since you have three backup characters. However, it may be a good idea to have the highest HP party members out initially. If everyone is alive, that's more License Points for them all.
- ***NOTE***: I apparently misunderstood and didn't realize that Vossler could still have gambits on until I got to the Tiamat fight for **Beast My Guest II**. Whoops!

**Privateer** (Sky Pirate's Den): I got this while stocking up on Potions and selling loot at Raithwall's Tomb. Selling at least 1000 loot will unlock the Migelo statue in the Den.

**Seething Mist** (Challenge): This fight requires that we have Fran in the party and don't use our new summon, any quickenings, and no deaths. Everyone should still be less than level 25 as well if you skipped back to the entrance after getting the Dawn Shard.
- When you leave The Tomb of Raithwall, make sure to put Fran in your active party and use the Save Crystal just before hand in case things go awry. The challenge here is that Fran is berserk because of the Mist. If Fran is very strong or a DPS, she may push Vossler into the second half of the fight quickly, so make sure to take care of the additional enemies quickly.
- Once the fight starts, successfully steal from the boss with any of your other teammates (the three additional swordman with him don't have to be stolen from). If all the conditions are right and you successful steal, the primed achievement marker will appear.
- The hardest part will be the second half of the fight. Vossler will maintain Reflect on himself and will more frequently combo. I'd recommend shifting from Cure to Cura, if you have it, to keep up with the damage that Vossler will deal to one person. If the fight has gone on long, Fran's berserk will drop off and she can provide support again.
- **New level cap**: Two future bosses must be defeated with an accompanying guest character below level 30. Ensure levels stay low enough that the guest does not join with their level too high (average level of the two highest level characters + 2 levels).

### Power of Dawn ➡️ A Pleasant Lie That

***Level Cap Reminder***: Level 30 for the next two bosses. You will have a guest character for both of these fights and they will join at a higher level than your party (average level of the two highest level characters + 2 levels).

**Thief of the Sand Falls/Passage of Death** (Treasure?/Stealing?): After the events that result in the **Power of Dawn** achievement and you regain control in Rabanastre, the primed achievement marker appears for **Passage of Death**. However, BOTH of these achievements must be earned prior to seeing the Garif War-chief. The **Thief of the Sand Falls** primes only in the room that they can spawn in at Zertinan Caverns. So keep both of these in mind before events that require speaking to the Garif War-chief.

**A Scream from the Sky** (Hunts): The Wyvern Lord is in Nam-Yensa Sandsea: Simoon Bluff, an optional area with some good gear on top of this mark. You could do the fight before The Tomb of Raithwall (and Vossler will be helpful with his Telekinesis technick) but if levels are close to cap, like mine was, you may want to wait until afterword. There are a lot of other enemies in the region that will like to butt in while fighting the Wyvern Lord and their experience points may push you over. As for the fight, you'll want to use characters that can hit airborne enemies: ranged fighters, magic users, and pole or spear wielders. Quickenings can help as well. If you don't have a lot of ranged attackers, make one that can't hit a tank using Decoy to avoid the mark from picking on your magic users. Sleep is a good status effect as well. Set up a party of magic casters and one with a gambit that casts Sleep whenever it wears off and you'll stun lock this fiend until it's dead. Just don't cast Aero or you'll heal it.

**Sister's Path (cont'd)**: With the Dawn Shard in hand, Ktjn has a new question to for you. Return to her spot on the stairs at Muthru Bazaar. After a bit of conversation, she asks, "I would be as she is. Do you think it is possible?" You will want to respond "It'll never happen" in order to get the Runeblade. Only one more question remains...

**Thief of the Sand Falls** (Treasure?): Exit Rabanastre at Westgate and go through Dalmasca Westersand to the entrance to Zertinan Caverns. Once inside, you'll want to just run from everything, making your way to the Sandfalls zone. Head immediately south to Hourglass Basin and hit the boulder to continue. Run past the Buers to the south exit that leads to a seeming dead end in The Undershore zone. Upon entering, you'll see the primed achievement indicator. There is a passage to the east of the Save Crystal that isn't on the map, between two sand falls. Make a u-turn to the right to where a chest with the Thief's Cuffs has a 25% chance of spawning. There is an exit on this side of the sand falls to the north that is convenient for rezoning to try to get the chest to spawn. If you didn't save at the Save Crystal, you could reload an earlier save if you don't want to keep the accessory for now, or just run again through the Buers and other enemies back out the exit to the Westersand.

**Calm the Sandstorm** (Side Quest): Talk to Rimzat, a bangaa near the exit to the Westersand in Rabanastre: Westgate, and agree to help an investigation into the sandstorm at Wyrm's Nest. You'll need to speak to Cotze, a hume sitting on the fountain in Southern Plaza. Now head to Lowtown, just south of Storehouse 5 to speak to Northon, a hume crouched speaking with a bangaa. Now you know where one part of the windvane you need for the storm is located. We will get to the rest of this quest later.

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: If you haven't been to Nalbina Town yet, now's the time to do so in preparation for completing a later side quest. Touch the Teleport Save Crystal here to register the teleport spot.

**Chocobo Past** (Side Quest): You can only start this quest now at Nalbina Town, between the events at The Tomb of Raithwall and Mt. Bur-Omisace. Right by the Teleport Save Crystal is July, a hume crouching behind a stone and looking at two imperial guards. Talk to her. Next, approach the guards she's listening to. All this talk about chocobos and a stall right near by... Rent a chocobo from the stall and ride toward the imperial guards. That's the quest! You'll get the reward and achievement later on when you see July again in Archadies. You also now have access to the Mosphoran Highwaste and a backdoor to the Valeblossom Dew that you need.

**Covered Up In Flowers/Treasure Hunter Mog (cont'd)**: If you are continuing on from the **Chocobo Past** event and still have the chocobo you rented, it'll make getting through Mosphoran Highwaste to Dalmasca Estersand much easier since the enemies here are probably too tough. Take the northwest exit into Summit Path and follow the left wall until you reach the exit to the Estersand. This is the Broken Sands, where you'll find the Valeblossom Dew that Dantro's Wife needs. You will have to dismount the chocobo in order to get the items. Be wary of the Wild Saurians! The Worgens you will probably be able to handle without too much problem, especially if you use the Water spell. Most other fiends in the zone are not aggressive. Look for Mysterious Glint pickups around what looks like cherry trees along the southern central crevice and get three Valeblossom Dews from them. Run back to Nalbina and teleport or walk back to Dalmasca Estersand: South Bank Village.

**Show Off I and II (cont'd)**: You should be more than strong enough to handle Nekhbet, a rare game cockatrice that may appear in the Sand-swept Naze zone, at this point. If you are passing through for **Covered Up In Flowers/Treasure Hunter Mog** and you see it appear, take it out.

**Covered Up In Flowers/Treasure Hunter Mog (cont'd)**: You can't give the Valeblossom Dew to Dantro's Wife quite yet as the village needs us to head to the north bank via the ferry to see what is wrong. Speak to the boy on the pier to cross the river. Talk to Ruksel, the boy's father. Return across the river and speak to Dantro's Wife. Follow her advice and look at the flower behind the house. Now head back across the river and approach the large cactroid to complete the **Covered Up In Flowers** portion of the quest.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: You'll find a Cartographer's Guild moogle at the North Bank Village after saving them from the cactroids. Purchase the Mosphoran Highwaste map.

**Treasure Hunter Mog (cont'd)**: Return across the river yet again and speak to Dantro's Wife once more to finally deliver the Valeblossom Dew and Great Serpentskin. Head out of the village and return to speak to her yet again. Head behind her house once again and find the moogle that you have helped cure. If you found all of the ingredients that Dantro's Wife needed, you'll get the Barheim Key, a Golden Amulet, and the achievement. If the moogle doesn't appear right away (Dantro's Wife says they should be recovering soon rather than fully healed), go back out of the village and wait a bit before returning.

**Passage of Death** (Stealing?): With both the Thief's Cuffs and the Barheim Key, you are prepared to try to get the Deathbringer. The weapon is stolen from the rare game Ithuno in Barheim Passage: Special Op Sector 5. The fiend is similar to the Mimics in that it will appear as a treasure chest. It has a 20% chance of spawning at the end of the zone, nearby the one-time Arc Scale chest and directly next to a 90% spawning chest that may contain an Aero Mote or Glacial Staff.
- From Dalmasca Estersand: South Bank Village, head to the locked door that leads to Barheim Passage, found in the Murmuring Defile zone. Use the Barheim Key to unlock it and you'll be back in Barheim Passage: The Zeviah Subterrane. Proceed to Special Op Sector 5 via Great Central Passage's southwest exit.
- Be aware that the enemies in this zone will greatly exceed your current level and will take you out in one or two hits. Just run!
- Make your way to the end of Special Op Sector 5 and hope that the mimic chest is there. It'll have a purple body with silver sides compared to the normal brown and gray chest color. You'll see it directly behind a bolder on the train tracks.
- There is a high level Suriander (frog enemy) that hangs out directly near the mimic chest.
- Some good preparation can make this go more smoothly:
  - Tank: Set them as the party leader. As your highest defense character, they should be attacking the Ithuno to keep aggro on themselves while your stealer is busy. Add gambits to throw Hi-Potions and Ethers if necessary.
  - Healer: Set up gambits to cast Protect on the whole party. It's not a huge defense boost, but it will keep the party alive a little bit longer to get healing done. Set up Cura casts at a higher HP threshold than normal. I used less than 60% HP to keep the Cura flowing.
  - Stealer: Ensure they have the Thief's Cuffs equipped! Their ONLY gambit should be to steal from whatever foe the party leader is targeting.
- After running in and seeing if Ithuno is even spawned, use the corner away from the tortoise and the Suriander by Ithuno where your healer can prep Protect on everyone and heal up if any damage was taken on the way in. You should draw no aggro in this corner, nor should your party end up targeting any monsters in this spot.
- Attempt to interact with the Ithuno chest to start the stealing process while the Suriander is not looking. If you do draw in the Suriander, run back to the corner and it should pull back, along with the Ithuno.
- Once the Ithuno and ONLY the Ithuno is targeting your tank, the stealing should commence. With Thief's Cuffs, the steal chance is 6% so it may take a while.
- If it is taking long and MP is getting drained (or if you want to be preemptive about it while your Protect is up), try to lure Ithuno toward the zone exit. This is tricky because of the other monsters along the way and Ithuno may try to run back if aggro is not maintained. The tank should be able to continue maintaining attacks while you also pull back and the healer tries to keep everyone alive.
  - The goal of drawing Ithuno to the exit is so that you can zone out, heal and buff up without dealing with taking damage, and then zone back in where Ithuno will be waiting for you to continue stealing from.
- In my own attempts at this, I struggled initially just trying to run in there and steal as I was getting wiped by the Ithuno and Suriander. I came up with the formation and gambits above to try to do a sustained stealing session with the intent that I'd just get the achievement and then reset. Once I set up my party of Basch, Balthier, and Fran with the above and drew the Ithuno into the safe corner, Fran stole the Deathbringer in three attempts! As soon as I heard the achievement, I booked it out of there and got to keep the thing without burning through a ton of resources. I hope others are just as lucky with this as I was but hopefully this strategy helps with making this a bit easier to deal with.

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: With Barheim Passage accessible again, make sure to touch the Teleport Save Crystal in the North-South Junction to activate this teleport spot.

**The Bhujerba Madhu Man** (Side Quest): Completing this little quest that has no impact on the game will enable you to make some money as well as enter all of Bhujerba's zones for the **Cartography** achievement. The goal here is to find all of the bottles of Bhujerban Madhu around the city and give them to people who want them to earn 1000 gil per bottle. I'll list location, where the bottle is found, and who wants to buy it. For the achievement, you do not have to have all of the bottles in your possession first. Feel free to sell them as you find them. You can sell another bottle to the same seller if you leave a zone and reenter to reset their status.
- Aerodrome: Bottle is on suitcases north of the Save Crystal. The buyer is sitting on railing talking to imperials right nearby.
- Armor shop: Bottle is in a partially open cupboard by the store merchant. Sell it to the Shop Clerk standing in front of the counter (right next to the cupboard).
- Weapon shop: Bottle is on crates up the stairs near the entrance, next to a display with hammers. Sell it to a woman near the crossbows on the lower level.
- Magick shop: Bottle is on counters topped with urns and bottles up the stairs near the entrance. Sell it to the Bhujerban Guru just to the left of where the bottle was.
- Travica Way: Bottle is on the ground near the southeast exit of the zone, where a man is crouching while talking to Street Kid. You can sell it to a Bhujerban man leaning against the wall across the street from the magick shop.
- Khus Skygrounds: Bottle is on a crate with a moogle standing on it, north of the street merchant. Sell it to the Bhujerban woman on the west side of the zone somewhat near a seeq.
- Technicks shop: Bottle is on a stack of books near the stairs by the shop counter. Sell it to the moogle Shop Clerk standing on the carpet in the middle of the shop.
- Miners' End: Bottle is on crates just south of the gambit shop entrance. You can sell it to the bangaa labeled as Lhusu Miner just south of the intersection from the gambit shop.
- Gambit shop: Bottle is on a bookshelf right up the stairs near the entrance. Sell it to the seeq Shop Clerk near the opposite stairs.
- Kaff Terrace: Bottle is to the right, just as you step on the bridge, on the railing next to a seeq. Sell it to a Bhujerban woman at the north end near the edge after the bridge railing.
- Lhusu Square: Bottle is near the entrance to the mine, on the rail where water is flowing down the slope. Sell it to the Lhusu Miner hume sitting on a box near the seeq merchant.
- The Staras Residence: Bottle is just right of the entrance, on some boxes behind a large dresser. You can sell it to Niray, but you can't sell it to her until later. Perhaps you can sell it to one of the others who wants to buy bottles.
- Cloudborne Row: Bottle is just south of the Staras Residence on some boxes in the dead end alley. Sell it to the Cloudborne Patron hume standing over a collapsed bangaa.
- The Cloudborne: The final bottle is on a table with two women, one with her head on the table. The achievement unlocks once you pick it up. You can sell it to Magu, a seeq sitting among a bunch of urns in an alcove of the tavern near the entrance.

**Show Off I and II (cont'd)**: While traversing Giza Plains during the Rains, there is a 20% chance of the Rain Dancer rare game spawning in a few of the zones. I found it in Toam Hills just south of the bridge where a Gigantoad was sleeping.

**Paradise Risen** (Hunts): While you are probably not ready to defeat the Gil Snapper yet, you can certainly prepare to access the location it is in while making your way around Giza Plains by knocking down withered trees. There are six trees in all the Giza Plains zones except for Gizas South Bank and Warrior's Wash. Knocking all of them down lets you reach Tracks of the Beast. I'll be tackling Gil Snapper later. I have knocked down four of the trees, leaving only the ones in Gizas North Bank and Crystal Glade since I didn't go to those zones while hunting the Croakadile.

**A Ring in the Rain** (Hunts): Since the Rains are currently active in Giza Plains, this is a good time to tackle the Croakadile. Find the quest giver in Nomad Village near the cockatrice pen to start the quest. Travel west and south to Starfall Field. Cross the bridge and head east until the Croakadile jumps out of the water and begins to sing...
- It starts off with Shell and Bravery and uses the Angelsong skill as it's first move, giving itself Regen. If you cast Dispel (or use a Dispel Mote), it'll remove all of the buffs and then keep trying to reapply Regen. You could keep it locked in this state for a while.
- Once about halfway down, it increases in strength with Growing Threat but it isn't too terrible with it's increased damage output. Throw Hi-Potions and cast Cura as needed while keeping up with dealing damage.
- Return the Ring of the Toad and you'll get your reward, achievement, and asked to return the ring to its owner later.

**Hunter of Monsters I** (Bestiary?): If you haven't unlocked this achievement before entering Ozmone Plain, you more than likely will then. As with some of these other bestiary type achievements, experiences will vary for when you unlock them.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: You can get maps for Ozmone Plain and Jahara from a Cartographer's Guild moogle near the chocobo stable in Jahara. You still have to enter every zone in these areas, but the maps will make things easier.

**Thief of the Sand Falls/Passage of Death (cont'd)**: Reminder that these must be completed prior to continuing into Jahara as you will meet the Garif War-chief upon trying to cross the bridge.

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: Another Teleport Save Crystal is at the entrance into Jahara. Interact with it to register the location.

**Beast My Guest II/Ward of the Wood** (Challenge): After the events at Jahara, Larsa will join as a guest (average of the two highest character levels + 2 levels). My Larsa joined at level 23, as a point of reference. Now you will want to keep an eye on Larsa's level for these two boss challenge achievements. Don't let him reach level 31!

**The Defense of Ozmone Plain** (Hunts): Speak to the petitioner in Jahara to start the hunt and then head to The Shred. Enkelados shouldn't be too difficult for a party with levels in the low 20s.
- It starts off with Protect and Shell. You can Dispel these if you wish and Enkelados may occasionally reapply these buffs., but not necessarily as aggressively as Croakadile did.
- This mark seems to just use physical attacks, dealing more damage as it's health drops. It also uses a multihit physical skill called Spinkick.
- It can cure itself with the Restore skill up to three times.
- My strategy was to use Larsa's Bubble spell and Decoy from any other caster on my tank to keep Enkelados off of my magic user, who was using the Aero spell. Everyone else was doing physical attacks and curing as needed. I could have used Dispel but it wasn't really necessary. It only healed itself once and tried a second time before I killed it.

**Soul Mate Matchmaker** (Side Quest): A little quest that you can handle at any time after having visited Jahara for the first time. In Rabanastre: Southgate, speak to the viera at the chocobo stables. You'll know you are talking to the right one when the title during her text box says, "Wandering Viera". She walks off toward Southern Plaza. Follow after her and speak with the hume on the north side of the fountain, labeled as "Lovestruck Man". He says that he saw a viera that looks like the one that he fell in love with that went into East End. Follow after her (this is creepy...) and you'll not find her there. She actually went to the gambit shop in North End. After speaking with her, the wandering viera wanders off again, this time to The Sandsea. Speak to her twice more (she's sitting on the railing upstairs). Now run back to Lovestruck Man and agree to be his matchmaker. Return to The Sandsea once more to let her know and then go back to the fountain to get the viera's bow and the achievement. Good job, Cupid!

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: There is a map urn in Golmore Jungle: Paths of Chained Light, the first zone you'll enter. You won't be able to enter all zones in the region just yet, but the map will help you track it later.

**Show Off I and II (cont'd)**: The rare game Midgardsormr has a 20% chance of appearing anywhere in the zone when entering it. If you wish to take it down now, it may be easier to clear out the enemies in the zone first and then just rezone and pass through quickly to see if it spawned while the enemies are gone. It's probably best to wait for this until later, unless you get lucky and it shows up on your way through, since Larsa will gain levels quickly and approach the level cap before you know it.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: Upon entering Eruyt Village speak to the moogle Lulluce to buy a map of the town. You will be visiting all of the zones while you are here.

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: New village, new Teleport Save Crystal. Touch it and be registered.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: The map urn for The Henne Mines is in the Phase 1 Shaft zone, but you have to press the Gate Switchboard button in Pithead Junction A to open the gate to access it. Be cautious of the Jelly ambush after pressing the switch. You don't want to gain too much XP on Larsa before these two upcoming boss fights! Again, the map will be helpful in ensuring all zones are entered.

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: Another Teleport Save Crystal is placed just before the Tiamat boss fight in the Henne Mines. Make use of it to register the spot as well as save.

**Beast My Guest II** (Challenge): This is the first of two boss fight challenge achievements with a level 30 cap.
- It has the same restrictions as the fight with Belias: Party members must have gambits off (Larsa can still use gambits), always have three party members active (though they can die), party members can ONLY use Potions, and Larsa does everything he can to take down Tiamat.
- Since there is a teleport spot just before the boss, make use of it to max out your stock of Potions and get a handful of Gold Needles as well.
- Once you take the northern exit into the boss' arena, you'll see the primed achievement indicator if you met all of the conditions.
- At the start of the battle, make Larsa the party leader. Keep moving him around so that he can regenerate MP during the course of this long fight.
- Larsa has the Focus augment, increasing his strength by 1.5x when his HP is full. If Tiamat is focused on another character, it may help cut down on the time of the battle to try to top up Larsa's HP so that he does more damage.
- Take advantage of Larsa's Balance spell, especially when combined with Bubble. If Larsa is getting targeted and is at about half HP, use Balance to do a bunch of damage to Tiamat AND force the boss to cast Reflect. This gives you time to get Larsa's health back up. Just be careful to not let Larsa get too low on HP because Tiamat can do combo attacks on occasion and will decimate any character who's HP is too low. Once Reflect wears off, feel free to repeat the above when the opportunity presents itself. It may not be as possible to use this when Tiamat's health gets low though due to Tiamat's script changes.
- Tiamat will use Breath twice during the battle as its HP passes 40% and 20% thresholds. This will most likely inflict Sap on everyone except Larsa because of his Tourmaline Ring. Because of Breath happening twice, it may be prudent to try to keep the initial party members alive until the second Breath. This will ensure that the second group of characters don't get afflicted with the condition.
- Before swapping in your second team of characters, make absolutely certain that they have their gambits turned off before exiting the menu... Don't be like me and have to start over because of this. Turn them off on everyone before the fight! Also, make sure there are always three active party members while swapping. Bring the inactive characters in first before removing the active party.
- Disablega is, without a doubt, the worst part of this challenge. This will be the thing that causes a drain on your Potions the most as you try to keep Larsa alive with anyone who manages to not get afflicted. Hopefully you get lucky and Larsa will not get proc'd but it seemed to happen pretty frequently, lengthening the battle. The AI script states that Tiamat will use it when the opponents it wants to target are far away. However, I was standing right in front of the fiend along with the rest of my party and Tiamat was using it all the time... Maybe that was just bad luck on my part.
- I did notice that Tiamat is, seemingly, lazy in its selection of character to attack. If someone is directly in front of the fiend, it seems to want to attack them more than others. You can use this to your advantage by swapping party leader to someone else with high HP and put them in front of Tiamat as a potentially appetizing snack. This can spread the wealth in HP reduction or focus it on one who may be better at guarding than others.
- At 20% HP remaining, Tiamat's defense will increase as shown by Larsa's attacks doing about 60-75% less damage. Be on your toes for the remainder of the battle. Of course, Balance will still do the full amount of damage, as long as Reflect is off of Tiamat.
- Achievement will unlock on the final hit. That was definitely a test of endurance... Now there's only one of these **Beast My Guest** challenges remaining...

### A Pleasant Lie That ➡️ To Wield Power Against Power

***Level Cap Reminder***: The cap of level 30 still stands with one more boss fight rapidly approaching.

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: The number of teleport spots is getting larger. Interact with the newly accessible one in Golmore Jungle: The Parting Glade.

**Ward of the Wood** (Challenge): And here is the other level capped challenge! For this challenge, on top of being less than level 30, only Fran and Larsa can participate in the fight with none of them dying. Larsa cannot have gambits on (but can use anything available to him). Fran cannot use espers or quickenings. Thankfully, the Save Crystal is nearby so you can prepare and try different things quickly to see how it works.
- Prepare by ensuring Larsa's gambits are off, and putting at least Bubble on Fran and Larsa. If you have Protect available on Fran, that would be good to prepare as well. If you have Aero available on Fran, that would be the spell to have as your primary attack gambit. Aero/Aeroga Motes are a backup to Aero, if you happen to have any. If you have the Sleep spell on Fran, that should be used before your attack gambit, if you have spells available for attacking. Stock up on items to cure status effects like Smelling Salts for removing Confuse, Handkerchief for removing Oil, or if you have Esuna available, you could use that though it may be better to save MP for dealing damage.
- When using spells, keep moving around the arena to keep your MP regenerating as long as you can. While Fran acts automatically with gambits, manually direct Larsa to use items or Shades of Black to support Fran. Keeping your distance, if possible, can also help potentially avoid the Sporefall skill when the Elder Wyrm uses it.
- When Sporefall is used, recover from any status effects as necessary. Oil is particularly important to remove because if Elder Wyrm follows up with Fireball, expect to die.
- Larsa should be focused on healing and perhaps trying to keep Elder Wyrm's focus with attacks or Shades of Black. You'll need to be attentive to Larsa being inactive and issue commands as the battle goes on. This is hard to do in fast forward, unfortunately, but if you can manage keeping Larsa active while in fast forward, by all means do so. With luck, Larsa's Shades of Black uses will produce things like Scathe, Flare, and Aeroga! If Fran is NOT a Red or Black Mage, then Shades of Black will probably be your primary means of dealing damage instead.
- So, if Fran isn't a Red or Black Mage, there are some recommendations on the achievement's comments about what to do. The consensus is to get the Nihopalaoa accessory. This makes items do the inverse of what their intended action is. For example: throwing a potion will hurt the target rather than heal. For the Elder Wyrm, using Alarm Clocks on it will put it to sleep, guaranteed! Fran should then be trying to keep Elder Wyrm asleep while Larsa uses Shades of Black.
  - To get the Nihopalaoa, you'll need to grind for loot to sell that will unlock it in the bazaar. You need to sell three Blood-stained Necklace, two Death's-Head, and three Leo Gem. Note that these all come from higher level enemies and will require stealing to avoid exceeding levels.
    - Blood-stained Necklace: Shambling Corpse (found in Zertinan Caverns: Athroza Quicksands) rare steal or dropped from them if you have the Warmage's Monograph
    - Death's-Head: Dark Skeleton (found in Golmore Jungle: The Rusting Chapel) drop with Warmage's Monograph, rare game Grave Lord's rare steal (found in same place after chaining the Dark Skeletons that appear there)...
    - Leo Gem: Drop/steal from various dragons and dinosaurs. Wild Saurian is probably the most accessible to steal them from.
    - As you can see, this is pretty ridiculous to do while trying to maintain low levels. It may be easier to just fight it out if you have a damage dealing Fran, or a Fran that blocks a lot can take point on tank duties while Larsa casts random black magic. You can grind Aero/Aeroga Motes from chests as well. There are options, but Nihopalaoa seems excessive to get.
- Once the Elder Wyrm is defeated, we have a new level cap: level 32. It's not much of a difference, but Larsa won't be with us for the next one, so you should actually have more room.

**Show Off I and II (cont'd)**: With the level cap lifted somewhat, you can try to take out the rare game Phyllo in The Branchway. It has a 20% spawn chance at the dead end on the west side or on the west side of the southern path. It's probably easiest to just rezone and check the western dead end until it shows up. Phyllo is a bat-like Redmaw enemy. Some sources mention that its appearance is based on wiping out the malboros in the area but that is not the case.

**Ivalice Explorer (cont'd)**: Welcome to Mt. Bur-Omisace. New city area, new Teleport Save Crystal. Touch it and add this location to your collection.

**Cartographer (cont'd)**: Another Cartographer's Guild moogle is here with maps for Mt. Bur-Omisace and Paramina Rift. Stock up and we'll eventually enter the associated zones.

**Show Off I and II (cont'd)**: In Paramina Rift: Karydine Glacier, the rare game Anchag can spawn near the south center section of the zone if all enemies are defeated. Clear everyone out, including Wild Onions, then zone out and back in to find it wandering alone. It is a Dullahan type fiend.
