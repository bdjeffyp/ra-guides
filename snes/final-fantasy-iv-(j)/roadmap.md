# Potential Order

The following is a breakdown of the order of achievements based on my personal playthrough. Note that your mileage may vary due to the path you may desire to take, such as getting Odin before going to the Moon.

This section is provided separately from the main guide to show all achievements without the spoiler guarding dropdowns.

Special call out: The incredibly grind heavy Evil Jewelry, Summoning Mastery, and One of a Kind. They will not be included in the order list below because of the rare drops involved in their achievements: 1/64 chance for the applicable item IF an item drops from the monster.

### The Departure ➡ A Heart's Resolve (7/130)

**Grind alert!** You can grind Spirits and Souls at the base of Mt. Ordeals for the Cursed Ring. See the Miscellaneous section below for the strategy. I did it here because of the need to level Cecil up after his class change.

### Wings of the Enterprise ➡ Partings and Reunions (71/130)

Things really open up now that an airship is in your possession!

**Grind alert!** Mindflayers in the Magnetic Cave can very rarely drop their eponymous summon. This is the only location they appear in this game, which is pretty inconvenient. It may be best to grind for the summon AFTER defeating the Dark Elf since the cave's magnetic properties will subside.

### Savior of Mist ➡ Pride of Fabul (84/130)

**Grind alert!** Balloons in the Tower of Babil can very rarely drop their eponymous summon. You can also get it from them and the Grenades on the Moon later, if you'd rather wait, since the drop rate is low.

**NOTE:** Elemental Cure is currently broken. It triggers when a FellKnight uses Absorb in the Defender Sword Monster-in-a-Box fight. It should be available to earn when a character has a Cursed Ring with an elemental reducing armor equipped. It isn't too big of a deal that this one achievement out of 130 pops early, given that you still need to grind for a Cursed Ring anyway... 😉

**Grind alert!** If you didn't get the Bomb summon earlier, grinding Balloons and Grenades in the Lunar Path caverns or the Moon overworld may be the next best opportunity.

### To the Dark Depths ➡ Life's Triumph (127/130)

**Grind alert!** If you don't have the remaining summon items, now is the time to get them. You will also be grinding for Pink Tail(s) in the Lunar Subterrane, and the Cursed Ring from the Souls and Spirits at Mt. Ordeals if you didn't get that earlier.

**NOTE:** The final boss must be fought more than once to complete the set. I would think it may be best to beat the game with the full party first, reload the save, then grind to get Cecil ready for the final fight...
